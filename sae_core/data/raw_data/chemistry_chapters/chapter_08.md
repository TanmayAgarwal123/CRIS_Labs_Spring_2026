Figure 8.1 Oxygen molecules orient randomly most of the time, as shown in the top magnified view. However, when we pour liquid oxygen through a magnet, the molecules line up with the magnetic field, and the attraction allows them to stay suspended between the poles of the magnet where the magnetic field is strongest. Other diatomic molecules (like  ) flow past the magnet. The detailed explanation of bonding described in this chapter allows us to understand this phenomenon.

INTRODUCTION We have examined the basic ideas of bonding, showing that atoms share electrons to form molecules with stable Lewis structures and that we can predict the shapes of those molecules by valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory. These ideas provide an important starting point for understanding chemical bonding. But these models sometimes fall short in their abilities to predict the behavior of real substances. How can we reconcile the geometries of s,  and  atomic orbitals with molecular shapes that show angles like  and  Furthermore, we know that electrons and magnetic behavior are related through electromagnetic fields. Both  and  have fairly similar Lewis structures that contain lone pairs of electrons.

 Yet oxygen demonstrates very different magnetic behavior than nitrogen. We can pour liquid nitrogen througha magnetic field with no visible interactions, while liquid oxygen (shown in Figure 8.1) is attracted to the magnet and floats in the magnetic field. We need to understand the additional concepts of valence bond theory, orbital hybridization, and molecular orbital theory to understand these observations.

Describe the formation of covalent bonds in terms of atomic orbital overlap Define and give examples of σ and π bonds

As we know, a scientific theory is a strongly supported explanation for observed natural laws or large bodies of experimental data. For a theory to be accepted, it must explain experimental data and be able to predict behavior. For example, VSEPR theory has gained widespread acceptance because it predicts threedimensional molecular shapes that are consistent with experimental data collected for thousands of different molecules. However, VSEPR theory does not provide an explanation of chemical bonding.

There are successful theories that describe the electronic structure of atoms. We can use quantum mechanics to predict the specific regions around an atom where electrons are likely to be located: A spherical shape for an  orbital, a dumbbell shape for a  orbital, and so forth. However, these predictions only describe the orbitals around free atoms. When atoms bond to form molecules, atomic orbitals are not sufficient to describe the regions where electrons will be located in the molecule. A more complete understanding of electron distributions requires a model that can account for the electronic structure of molecules. One popular theory holds that a covalent bond forms when a pair of electrons is shared by two atoms and is simultaneously attracted by the nuclei of both atoms. In the following sections, we will discuss how such bonds are described by valence bond theory and hybridization.

Valence bond theory describes a covalent bond as the overlap of half-filled atomic orbitals (each containing a single electron) that yield a pair of electrons shared between the two bonded atoms. We say that orbitals on two different atoms overlap when a portion of one orbital and a portion of a second orbital occupy the same region of space. According to valence bond theory, a covalent bond results when two conditions are met: (1) an orbital on one atom overlaps an orbital on a second atom and (2) the single electrons in each orbital combine to form an electron pair. The mutual attraction between this negatively charged electron pair and the two atoms’ positively charged nuclei serves to physically link the two atoms through a force we define as a covalent bond. The strength of a covalent bond depends on the extent of overlap of the orbitals involved. Orbitals that overlap extensively form bonds that are stronger than those that have less overlap.

The energy of the system depends on how much the orbitals overlap. Figure 8.2 illustrates how the sum of the energies of two hydrogen atoms (the colored curve) changes as they approach each other. When the atoms are far apart there is no overlap, and by convention we set the sum of the energies at zero. As the atoms move together, their orbitals begin to overlap. Each electron begins to feel the attraction of the nucleus in the other atom. In addition, the electrons begin to repel each other, as do the nuclei. While the atoms are still widely separated, the attractions are slightly stronger than the repulsions, and the energy of the system decreases. (A bond begins to form.) As the atoms move closer together, the overlap increases, so the attraction of the nuclei for the electrons continues to increase (as do the repulsions among electrons and between the nuclei). At some specific distance between the atoms, which varies depending on the atoms involved, the energy reaches its lowest (most stable) value. This optimum distance between the two bonded nuclei is the bond distance between the two atoms. The bond is stable because at this point, the attractive and repulsive forces combine to create the lowest possible energy configuration. If the distance between the nuclei were to decrease further, the repulsions between nuclei and the repulsions as electrons are confined in closer proximity to each other would become stronger than the attractive forces. The energy of the system would then rise (making the system destabilized), as shown at the far left of Figure 8.2.  
FIGURE 8.2 (a) The interaction of two hydrogen atoms changes as a function of distance. (b) The energy of the system changes as the atoms interact. The lowest (most stable) energy occurs at a distance of  , which is the bond length observed for the  molecule.

The bond energy is the difference between the energy minimum (which occurs at the bond distance) and the energy of the two separated atoms. This is the quantity of energy released when the bond is formed. Conversely, the same amount of energy is required to break the bond. For the  molecule shown in Figure 8.2, at the bond distance of  the system is  J lower in energy than the two separated hydrogen atoms. This may seem like a small number. However, we know from our earlier description of thermochemistry that bond energies are often discussed on a per-mole basis. For example, it requires   to break one  bond, but it takes  to break 1 mole of  bonds. A comparison of some bond lengths and energies is shown in Table 8.1. We can find many of these bonds in a variety of molecules, and this table provides average values. For example, breaking the first  bond in  requires  , while breaking the first  bond in  (a common paint thinner) requires  .

In addition to the distance between two orbitals, the orientation of orbitals also affects their overlap (other than for two  orbitals, which are spherically symmetric). Greater overlap is possible when orbitals are oriented such that they overlap on a direct line between the two nuclei. Figure 8.3 illustrates this for two  orbitals from different atoms; the overlap is greater when the orbitals overlap end to end rather than at an angle.

  
FIGURE 8.3 (a) The overlap of two  orbitals is greatest when the orbitals are directed end to end. (b) Any other arrangement results in less overlap. The dots indicate the locations of the nuclei.

The overlap of two  orbitals (as in  ), the overlap of an  orbital and a  orbital (as in HCl), and the end-to-end overlap of two  orbitals (as in  ) all produce sigma bonds (σ bonds), as illustrated in Figure 8.4. A σ bond is a covalent bond in which the electron density is concentrated in the region along the internuclear axis; that is, a line between the nuclei would pass through the center of the overlap region. Single bonds in Lewis structures are described as  bonds in valence bond theory.

  
FIGURE 8.4 Sigma (σ) bonds form from the overlap of the following: (a) two s orbitals, (b) an  orbital and a  orbital, and (c) two  orbitals. The dots indicate the locations of the nuclei.

A pi bond (π bond) is a type of covalent bond that results from the side-by-side overlap of two  orbitals, as illustrated in Figure 8.5. In a π bond, the regions of orbital overlap lie on opposite sides of the internuclear axis. Along the axis itself, there is a node, that is, a plane with no probability of finding an electron.

  
FIGURE 8.5 Pi (π) bonds form from the side-by-side overlap of two  orbitals. The dots indicate the location of the nuclei.

While all single bonds are σ bonds, multiple bonds consist of both σ and π bonds. As the Lewis structures below suggest,  contains a double bond, and  contains a triple bond. The double bond consists of one σ bond and one π bond, and the triple bond consists of one σ bond and two π bonds. Between any two atoms, thefirst bond formed will always be a σ bond, but there can only be one σ bond in any one location. In any multiple bond, there will be one σ bond, and the remaining one or two bonds will be π bonds. These bonds are described in more detail later in this chapter.

H-CI: :O=o: :NEN: • One σ bond One σ bond One σ bond No  bonds One  bond Two  bonds

As seen in Table 8.1, an average carbon-carbon single bond is  , while in a carbon-carbon double bond, the π bond increases the bond strength by  . Adding an additional π bond causes a further increase of  . We can see a similar pattern when we compare other σ and π bonds. Thus, each individual π bond is generally weaker than a corresponding σ bond between the same two atoms. In a σ bond, there is a greater degree of orbital overlap than in a π bond.

# Solution

There are six  bonds and one  bond, for a total of seven from the single bonds. There are two double bonds that each have a π bond in addition to the  bond. This gives a total nine σ and two π bonds overall.

# 8.2 Hybrid Atomic Orbitals

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Explain the concept of atomic orbital hybridization Determine the hybrid orbitals associated with various molecular geometriesThinking in terms of overlapping atomic orbitals is one way for us to explain how chemical bonds form in diatomic molecules. However, to understand how molecules with more than two atoms form stable bonds, we require a more detailed model. As an example, let us consider the water molecule, in which we have one oxygen atom bonding to two hydrogen atoms. Oxygen has the electron configuration  , with two unpaired electrons (one in each of the two  orbitals). Valence bond theory would predict that the two  bonds form from the overlap of these two  orbitals with the 1s orbitals of the hydrogen atoms. If this were the case, the bond angle would be  , as shown in Figure 8.6, because  orbitals are perpendicular to each other. Experimental evidence shows that the bond angle is  , not  . The prediction of the valence bond theory model does not match the real-world observations of a water molecule; a different model is needed.

  
FIGURE 8.6 The hypothetical overlap of two of the  orbitals on an oxygen atom (red) with the 1s orbitals of two hydrogen atoms (blue) would produce a bond angle of  . This is not consistent with experimental evidence.1

Quantum-mechanical calculations suggest why the observed bond angles in  differ from those predicted by the overlap of the 1s orbital of the hydrogen atoms with the  orbitals of the oxygen atom. The mathematical expression known as the wave function,  , contains information about each orbital and the wavelike properties of electrons in an isolated atom. When atoms are bound together in a molecule, the wave functions combine to produce new mathematical descriptions that have different shapes. This process of combining the wave functions for atomic orbitals is called hybridization and is mathematically accomplished by the linear combination of atomic orbitals, LCAO, (a technique that we will encounter again later). The new orbitals that result are called hybrid orbitals. The valence orbitals in an isolated oxygen atom are a  orbital and three  orbitals. The valence orbitals in an oxygen atom in a water molecule differ; they consist of four equivalent hybrid orbitals that point approximately toward the corners of a tetrahedron (Figure 8.7). Consequently, the overlap of the O and H orbitals should result in a tetrahedral bond angle  . The observed angle of  is experimental evidence for which quantum-mechanical calculations give a useful explanation: Valence bond theory must include a hybridization component to give accurate predictions.

  
FIGURE 8.7 (a) A water molecule has four regions of electron density, so VSEPR theory predicts a tetrahedral arrangement of hybrid orbitals. (b) Two of the hybrid orbitals on oxygen contain lone pairs, and the other two overlap with the 1s orbitals of hydrogen atoms to form the  bonds in  . This description is more consistent with the experimental structure.

The following ideas are important in understanding hybridization:

1. Hybrid orbitals do not exist in isolated atoms. They are formed only in covalently bonded atoms.   
2. Hybrid orbitals have shapes and orientations that are very different from those of the atomic orbitals in isolated atoms.   
3. A set of hybrid orbitals is generated by combining atomic orbitals. The number of hybrid orbitals in a set is equal to the number of atomic orbitals that were combined to produce the set.4. All orbitals in a set of hybrid orbitals are equivalent in shape and energy.   
5. The type of hybrid orbitals formed in a bonded atom depends on its electron-pair geometry as predicted by the VSEPR theory.   
6. Hybrid orbitals overlap to form σ bonds. Unhybridized orbitals overlap to form π bonds.

In the following sections, we shall discuss the common types of hybrid orbitals.

# sp Hybridization

The beryllium atom in a gaseous  molecule is an example of a central atom with no lone pairs of electrons in a linear arrangement of three atoms. There are two regions of valence electron density in the  molecule that correspond to the two covalent Be–Cl bonds. To accommodate these two electron domains, two of the Be atom’s four valence orbitals will mix to yield two hybrid orbitals. This hybridization process involves mixing of the valence  orbital with one of the valence  orbitals to yield two equivalent sp hybrid orbitals that are oriented in a linear geometry (Figure 8.8). In this figure, the set of  orbitals appears similar in shape to the original  orbital, but there is an important difference. The number of atomic orbitals combined always equals the number of hybrid orbitals formed. The  orbital is one orbital that can hold up to two electrons. The  set is two equivalent orbitals that point  from each other. The two electrons that were originally in the  orbital are now distributed to the two  orbitals, which are half filled. In gaseous  , these half-filled hybrid orbitals will overlap with orbitals from the chlorine atoms to form two identical  bonds.

  
FIGURE 8.8 Hybridization of an s orbital (blue) and a  orbital (red) of the same atom produces two  hybrid orbitals (yellow). Each hybrid orbital is oriented primarily in just one direction. Note that each  orbital contains one lobe that is significantly larger than the other. The set of two  orbitals are oriented at  , which is consistent with the geometry for two domains.

We illustrate the electronic differences in an isolated Be atom and in the bonded Be atom in the orbital energylevel diagram in Figure 8.9. These diagrams represent each orbital by a horizontal line (indicating its energy) and each electron by an arrow. Energy increases toward the top of the diagram. We use one upward arrow to indicate one electron in an orbital and two arrows (up and down) to indicate two electrons of opposite spin.  
FIGURE 8.9 This orbital energy-level diagram shows the sp hybridized orbitals on Be in the linear  molecule. Each of the two  hybrid orbitals holds one electron and is thus half filled and available for bonding via overlap with a Cl  orbital.

When atomic orbitals hybridize, the valence electrons occupy the newly created orbitals. The Be atom had two valence electrons, so each of the sp orbitals gets one of these electrons. Each of these electrons pairs up with the unpaired electron on a chlorine atom when a hybrid orbital and a chlorine orbital overlap during the formation of the Be–Cl bonds.

Any central atom surrounded by just two regions of valence electron density in a molecule will exhibit sp hybridization. Other examples include the mercury atom in the linear  molecule, the zinc atom in  , which contains a linear  arrangement, and the carbon atoms in HCCH and  .

#  Hybridization

The valence orbitals of a central atom surrounded by three regions of electron density consist of a set of three  hybrid orbitals and one unhybridized  orbital. This arrangement results from  hybridization, the mixing of one  orbital and two  orbitals to produce three identical hybrid orbitals oriented in a trigonal planar geometry (Figure 8.10).  
FIGURE 8.10 The hybridization of an s orbital (blue) and two  orbitals (red) produces three equivalent  hybridized orbitals (yellow) oriented at  with respect to each other. The remaining unhybridized  orbital is not shown here, but is located along the z axis.

Although quantum mechanics yields the “plump” orbital lobes as depicted in Figure 8.10, sometimes for clarity these orbitals are drawn thinner and without the minor lobes, as in Figure 8.11, to avoid obscuring other features of a given illustration. We will use these “thinner” representations whenever the true view is too crowded to easily visualize.

  
FIGURE 8.11 This alternate way of drawing the trigonal planar  hybrid orbitals is sometimes used in more crowded figures.

The observed structure of the borane molecule,  , suggests  hybridization for boron in this compound. The molecule is trigonal planar, and the boron atom is involved in three bonds to hydrogen atoms (Figure 8.12). We can illustrate the comparison of orbitals and electron distribution in an isolated boron atom and in the bonded atom in  as shown in the orbital energy level diagram in Figure 8.13. We redistribute the three valence electrons of the boron atom in the three  hybrid orbitals, and each boron electron pairs with a hydrogen electron when  bonds form.

  
FIGURE 8.12  is an electron-deficient molecule with a trigonal planar structure.  
FIGURE 8.13 In an isolated B atom, there are one 2s and three  valence orbitals. When boron is in a molecule with three regions of electron density, three of the orbitals hybridize and create a set of three  orbitals and one unhybridized  orbital. The three half-filled hybrid orbitals each overlap with an orbital from a hydrogen atom to form three σ bonds in  .

Any central atom surrounded by three regions of electron density will exhibit  hybridization. This includes molecules with a lone pair on the central atom, such as ClNO (Figure 8.14), or molecules with two single bonds and a double bond connected to the central atom, as in formaldehyde,  , and ethene,  .

  
FIGURE 8.14 The central atom(s) in each of the structures shown contain three regions of electron density and are  hybridized. As we know from the discussion of VSEPR theory, a region of electron density contains all of the electrons that point in one direction. A lone pair, an unpaired electron, a single bond, or a multiple bond would each count as one region of electron density.

#  Hybridization

The valence orbitals of an atom surrounded by a tetrahedral arrangement of bonding pairs and lone pairs consist of a set of four  hybrid orbitals. The hybrids result from the mixing of one  orbital and all three  orbitals that produces four identical  hybrid orbitals (Figure 8.15). Each of these hybrid orbitals points toward a different corner of a tetrahedron.  
FIGURE 8.15 The hybridization of an s orbital (blue) and three  orbitals (red) produces four equivalent  hybridized orbitals (yellow) oriented at  with respect to each other.

A molecule of methane,  , consists of a carbon atom surrounded by four hydrogen atoms at the corners of a tetrahedron. The carbon atom in methane exhibits  hybridization. We illustrate the orbitals and electron distribution in an isolated carbon atom and in the bonded atom in  in Figure 8.16. The four valence electrons of the carbon atom are distributed equally in the hybrid orbitals, and each carbon electron pairs with a hydrogen electron when the C–H bonds form.

  
FIGURE 8.16 The four valence atomic orbitals from an isolated carbon atom all hybridize when the carbon bondsin a molecule like  with four regions of electron density. This creates four equivalent  hybridized orbitals.   
Overlap of each of the hybrid orbitals with a hydrogen orbital creates a C–H σ bond.

In a methane molecule, the  orbital of each of the four hydrogen atoms overlaps with one of the four  orbitals of the carbon atom to form a sigma (σ) bond. This results in the formation of four strong, equivalent covalent bonds between the carbon atom and each of the hydrogen atoms to produce the methane molecule,  .

The structure of ethane,  , is similar to that of methane in that each carbon in ethane has four neighboring atoms arranged at the corners of a tetrahedron—three hydrogen atoms and one carbon atom (Figure 8.17). However, in ethane an  orbital of one carbon atom overlaps end to end with an  orbital of a second carbon atom to form a σ bond between the two carbon atoms. Each of the remaining  hybrid orbitals overlaps with an  orbital of a hydrogen atom to form carbon–hydrogen σ bonds. The structure and overall outline of the bonding orbitals of ethane are shown in Figure 8.17. The orientation of the two  groups is not fixed relative to each other. Experimental evidence shows that rotation around σ bonds occurs easily.

  
FIGURE 8.17 (a) In the ethane molecule,  , each carbon has four  orbitals. (b) These four orbitals overlap to form seven σ bonds.

An  hybrid orbital can also hold a lone pair of electrons. For example, the nitrogen atom in ammonia is surrounded by three bonding pairs and a lone pair of electrons directed to the four corners of a tetrahedron. The nitrogen atom is  hybridized with one hybrid orbital occupied by the lone pair.

The molecular structure of water is consistent with a tetrahedral arrangement of two lone pairs and two bonding pairs of electrons. Thus we say that the oxygen atom is  hybridized, with two of the hybrid orbitals occupied by lone pairs and two by bonding pairs. Since lone pairs occupy more space than bonding pairs, structures that contain lone pairs have bond angles slightly distorted from the ideal. Perfect tetrahedra have angles of  , but the observed angles in ammonia  and water  are slightly smaller. Other examples of  hybridization include  ,  , and  .

#  and  Hybridization

To describe the five bonding orbitals in a trigonal bipyramidal arrangement, we must use five of the valence shell atomic orbitals (the  orbital, the three  orbitals, and one of the  orbitals), which gives five  hybrid orbitals. With an octahedral arrangement of six hybrid orbitals, we must use six valence shell atomic orbitals (the  orbital, the three  orbitals, and two of the  orbitals in its valence shell), which gives six  hybrid orbitals. These hybridizations are only possible for atoms that have  orbitals in their valence subshells (that is, not those in the first or second period).

In a molecule of phosphorus pentachloride,  , there are five P–Cl bonds (thus five pairs of valence electrons around the phosphorus atom) directed toward the corners of a trigonal bipyramid. We use the  orbital, the three  orbitals, and one of the  orbitals to form the set of five  hybrid orbitals (Figure 8.19) that are involved in the  bonds. Other atoms that exhibit  hybridization include the sulfur atom in  and the chlorine atoms in  and in  (The electrons on fluorine atoms are omitted for clarity.)  
FIGURE 8.18 The three compounds pictured exhibit  hybridization in the central atom and a trigonal bipyramid form.  and  have one lone pair of electrons on the central atom, and  has two lone pairs giving it the T-shape shown.

  
FIGURE 8.19 (a) The five regions of electron density around phosphorus in  require five hybrid  orbitals. (b) These orbitals combine to form a trigonal bipyramidal structure with each large lobe of the hybrid orbital pointing at a vertex. As before, there are also small lobes pointing in the opposite direction for each orbital (not shown for clarity).

The sulfur atom in sulfur hexafluoride,  , exhibits  hybridization. A molecule of sulfur hexafluoride has six bonding pairs of electrons connecting six fluorine atoms to a single sulfur atom. There are no lone pairs of electrons on the central atom. To bond six fluorine atoms, the  orbital, the three  orbitals, and two of the  orbitals form six equivalent  hybrid orbitals, each directed toward a different corner of an octahedron. Other atoms that exhibit  hybridization include the phosphorus atom in  the iodine atom in the interhalogens  ,  ,   and the xenon atom in  .

  
FIGURE 8.20 (a) Sulfur hexafluoride,  , has an octahedral structure that requires  hybridization. (b) The six  orbitals form an octahedral structure around sulfur. Again, the minor lobe of each orbital is not shown for clarity.

# Assignment of Hybrid Orbitals to Central Atoms

The hybridization of an atom is determined based on the number of regions of electron density that surround it. The geometrical arrangements characteristic of the various sets of hybrid orbitals are shown in Figure 8.21. These arrangements are identical to those of the electron-pair geometries predicted by VSEPR theory. VSEPR theory predicts the shapes of molecules, and hybrid orbital theory provides an explanation for how those shapes are formed. To find the hybridization of a central atom, we can use the following guidelines:

1. Determine the Lewis structure of the molecule.   
2. Determine the number of regions of electron density around an atom using VSEPR theory, in which single bonds, multiple bonds, radicals, and lone pairs each count as one region.   
3. Assign the set of hybridized orbitals from Figure 8.21 that corresponds to this geometry.<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Regions ofElectronDensity</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=2>Arrangement</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=2>Hybridization</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>linear</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>sp</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>180°</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>trigonal planar</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>sp2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>D120°</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>tetrahedral</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sp3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>trigonalbipyramidal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>sp^{d</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>90°120°</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>octahedral</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>90°90°</td></tr></table>

It is important to remember that hybridization was devised to rationalize experimentally observed molecular geometries. The model works well for molecules containing small central atoms, in which the valence electron pairs are close together in space. However, for larger central atoms, the valence-shell electron pairs are farther from the nucleus, and there are fewer repulsions. Their compounds exhibit structures that are often not consistent with VSEPR theory, and hybridized orbitals are not necessary to explain the observed data. For example, we have discussed the  bond angle in  ,  , which is more consistent with  hybrid orbitals  on the central atom than with  orbitals  . Sulfur is in the same group as oxygen, and  has a similar Lewis structure. However, it has a much smaller bond angle  , which indicates much less hybridization on sulfur than oxygen. Continuing down the group, tellurium is even larger than sulfur, and for  , the observed bond angle  is consistent with overlap of the  orbitals, without invoking hybridization. We invoke hybridization where it is necessary to explain the observed structures.

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Describe multiple covalent bonding in terms of atomic orbital overlap Relate the concept of resonance to π-bonding and electron delocalization

The hybrid orbital model appears to account well for the geometry of molecules involving single covalent bonds. Is it also capable of describing molecules containing double and triple bonds? We have already discussed that multiple bonds consist of σ and π bonds. Next we can consider how we visualize these components and how they relate to hybrid orbitals. The Lewis structure of ethene,  , shows us that each carbon atom is surrounded by one other carbon atom and two hydrogen atoms.



The three bonding regions form a trigonal planar electron-pair geometry. Thus we expect the σ bonds from each carbon atom are formed using a set of  hybrid orbitals that result from hybridization of two of the  orbitals and the  orbital (Figure 8.22). These orbitals form the C–H single bonds and the  bond in the  double bond (Figure 8.23). The π bond in the  double bond results from the overlap of the third (remaining)  orbital on each carbon atom that is not involved in hybridization. This unhybridized  orbital (lobes shown in red and blue in Figure 8.23) is perpendicular to the plane of the  hybrid orbitals. Thus the unhybridized  orbitals overlap in a side-by-side fashion, above and below the internuclear axis (Figure 8.23) and form a π bond.  
FIGURE 8.22 In ethene, each carbon atom is  hybridized, and the  orbitals and the  orbital are singly occupied. The hybrid orbitals overlap to form σ bonds, while the  orbitals on each carbon atom overlap to form a π bond.

  
FIGURE 8.23 In the ethene molecule,  , there are (a) five σ bonds. One  bond results from overlap of  hybrid orbitals on the carbon atom with one  hybrid orbital on the other carbon atom. Four  bonds result from the overlap between the C atoms'  orbitals with  orbitals on the hydrogen atoms. (b) The π bond is formed by the side-by-side overlap of the two unhybridized  orbitals in the two carbon atoms. The two lobes of the π bond are above and below the plane of the σ system.

In an ethene molecule, the four hydrogen atoms and the two carbon atoms are all in the same plane. If the two planes of  hybrid orbitals tilted relative to each other, the  orbitals would not be oriented to overlap efficiently to create the π bond. The planar configuration for the ethene molecule occurs because it is the most stable bonding arrangement. This is a significant difference between σ and π bonds; rotation around single (σ) bonds occurs easily because the end-to-end orbital overlap does not depend on the relative orientation of the orbitals on each atom in the bond. In other words, rotation around the internuclear axis does not change the extent to which the σ bonding orbitals overlap because the bonding electron density is symmetric about the axis. Rotation about the internuclear axis is much more difficult for multiple bonds; however, this would drastically alter the off-axis overlap of the π bonding orbitals, essentially breaking the π bond.

In molecules with sp hybrid orbitals, two unhybridized  orbitals remain on the atom (Figure 8.24). We find this situation in acetylene,  which is a linear molecule. The sp hybrid orbitals of the two carbon atoms overlap end to end to form a σ bond between the carbon atoms (Figure 8.25). The remaining sp orbitals form σ bonds with hydrogen atoms. The two unhybridized  orbitals per carbon are positioned such that they overlap side by side and, hence, form two π bonds. The two carbon atoms of acetylene are thus bound together by one  bond and two π bonds, giving a triple bond.  
FIGURE 8.24 Diagram of the two linear sp hybrid orbitals of a carbon atom, which lie in a straight line, and the two unhybridized  orbitals at perpendicular angles.

  
FIGURE 8.25 (a) In the acetylene molecule,  , there are two  bonds and a  triple bond involving one C–C σ bond and two  bonds. The dashed lines, each connecting two lobes, indicate the side-by-side overlap of the four unhybridized  orbitals. (b) This shows the overall outline of the bonds in  . The two lobes of each of the π bonds are positioned across from each other around the line of the  bond.

Hybridization involves only  bonds, lone pairs of electrons, and single unpaired electrons (radicals). Structures that account for these features describe the correct hybridization of the atoms. However, many structures also include resonance forms. Remember that resonance forms occur when various arrangements of π bonds are possible. Since the arrangement of π bonds involves only the unhybridized orbitals, resonance does not influence the assignment of hybridization.

For example, molecule benzene has two resonance forms (Figure 8.26). We can use either of these forms to determine that each of the carbon atoms is bonded to three other atoms with no lone pairs, so the correct hybridization is  . The electrons in the unhybridized  orbitals form π bonds. Neither resonance structure completely describes the electrons in the π bonds. They are not located in one position or the other, but in reality are delocalized throughout the ring. Valence bond theory does not easily address delocalization. Bonding in molecules with resonance forms is better described by molecular orbital theory. (See the next module.)

  
FIGURE 8.26 Each carbon atom in benzene,  , is  hybridized, independently of which resonance form is considered. The electrons in the  bonds are not located in one set of  orbitals or the other, but rather delocalized throughout the molecule.# EXAMPLE 8.4

Outline the basic quantum-mechanical approach to deriving molecular orbitals from atomic orbitals Describe traits of bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals Calculate bond orders based on molecular electron configurations Write molecular electron configurations for first- and second-row diatomic molecules • Relate these electron configurations to the molecules’ stabilities and magnetic properties

For almost every covalent molecule that exists, we can now draw the Lewis structure, predict the electron-pair geometry, predict the molecular geometry, and come close to predicting bond angles. However, one of the most important molecules we know, the oxygen molecule  , presents a problem with respect to its Lewis structure. We would write the following Lewis structure for  :

# . :o=o:

This electronic structure adheres to all the rules governing Lewis theory. There is an  double bond, and each oxygen atom has eight electrons around it. However, this picture is at odds with the magnetic behavior of oxygen. By itself,  is not magnetic, but it is attracted to magnetic fields. Thus, when we pour liquid oxygen past a strong magnet, it collects between the poles of the magnet and defies gravity, as in Figure 8.1. Such attraction to a magnetic field is called paramagnetism, and it arises in molecules that have unpaired electrons. And yet, the Lewis structure of  indicates that all electrons are paired. How do we account for this discrepancy?

Magnetic susceptibility measures the force experienced by a substance in a magnetic field. When we compare the weight of a sample to the weight measured in a magnetic field (Figure 8.27), paramagnetic samples that are attracted to the magnet will appear heavier because of the force exerted by the magnetic field. We can calculate the number of unpaired electrons based on the increase in weight.  
FIGURE 8.27 A Gouy balance compares the mass of a sample in the presence of a magnetic field with the mass with the electromagnet turned off to determine the number of unpaired electrons in a sample.

Experiments show that each  molecule has two unpaired electrons. The Lewis-structure model does not predict the presence of these two unpaired electrons. Unlike oxygen, the apparent weight of most molecules decreases slightly in the presence of an inhomogeneous magnetic field. Materials in which all of the electrons are paired are diamagnetic and weakly repel a magnetic field. Paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials do not act as permanent magnets. Only in the presence of an applied magnetic field do they demonstrate attraction or repulsion.

Water, like most molecules, contains all paired electrons. Living things contain a large percentage of water, so they demonstrate diamagnetic behavior. If you place a frog near a sufficiently large magnet, it will levitate. You can see videos (http://openstax.org/l/16diamagnetic) of diamagnetic floating frogs, strawberries, and more.

Molecular orbital theory (MO theory) provides an explanation of chemical bonding that accounts for the paramagnetism of the oxygen molecule. It also explains the bonding in a number of other molecules, such as violations of the octet rule and more molecules with more complicated bonding (beyond the scope of this text) that are difficult to describe with Lewis structures. Additionally, it provides a model for describing the energies of electrons in a molecule and the probable location of these electrons. Unlike valence bond theory, which uses hybrid orbitals that are assigned to one specific atom, MO theory uses the combination of atomic orbitals to yield molecular orbitals that are delocalized over the entire molecule rather than being localized on its constituent atoms. MO theory also helps us understand why some substances are electrical conductors, others are semiconductors, and still others are insulators. Table 8.2 summarizes the main points of the two complementary bonding theories. Both theories provide different, useful ways of describing molecular structure.TABLE 8.2

Molecular orbital theory describes the distribution of electrons in molecules in much the same way that the distribution of electrons in atoms is described using atomic orbitals. Using quantum mechanics, the behavior of an electron in a molecule is still described by a wave function,  , analogous to the behavior in an atom. Just like electrons around isolated atoms, electrons around atoms in molecules are limited to discrete (quantized) energies. The region of space in which a valence electron in a molecule is likely to be found is called a molecular orbital  . Like an atomic orbital, a molecular orbital is full when it contains two electrons with opposite spin.

We will consider the molecular orbitals in molecules composed of two identical atoms (  or  , for example). Such molecules are called homonuclear diatomic molecules. In these diatomic molecules, several types of molecular orbitals occur.

The mathematical process of combining atomic orbitals to generate molecular orbitals is called the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO). The wave function describes the wavelike properties of an electron. Molecular orbitals are combinations of atomic orbital wave functions. Combining waves can lead to constructive interference, in which peaks line up with peaks, or destructive interference, in which peaks line up with troughs (Figure 8.28). In orbitals, the waves are three dimensional, and they combine with in-phase waves producing regions with a higher probability of electron density and out-of-phase waves producing nodes, or regions of no electron density.

  
FIGURE 8.28 (a) When in-phase waves combine, constructive interference produces a wave with greater amplitude. (b) When out-of-phase waves combine, destructive interference produces a wave with less (or no) amplitude.

There are two types of molecular orbitals that can form from the overlap of two atomic  orbitals on adjacent atoms. The two types are illustrated in Figure 8.29. The in-phase combination produces a lower energy molecular orbital (read as "sigma-s") in which most of the electron density is directly between the nuclei. The out-of-phase addition (which can also be thought of as subtracting the wave functions) produces a higher energy  molecular orbital (read as "sigma-s-star") molecular orbital in which there is a node between the nuclei. The asterisk signifies that the orbital is an antibonding orbital. Electrons in a  orbital are attracted by both nuclei at the same time and are more stable (of lower energy) than they would be in the isolated atoms. Adding electrons to these orbitals creates a force that holds the two nuclei together, so we call these orbitals bonding orbitals. Electrons in the  orbitals are located well away from the region between the two nuclei. The attractive force between the nuclei and these electrons pulls the two nuclei apart. Hence, these orbitals are called antibonding orbitals. Electrons fill the lower-energy bonding orbital before the higher-energy antibonding orbital, just as they fill lower-energy atomic orbitals before they fill higher-energy atomic orbitals.

  
FIGURE 8.29 Sigma (σ) and sigma-star  molecular orbitals are formed by the combination of two s atomic orbitals. The dots (·) indicate the locations of nuclei.

You can watch animations (http://openstax.org/l/16molecorbital) visualizing the calculated atomic orbitals combining to form various molecular orbitals at the Orbitron website.

In  orbitals, the wave function gives rise to two lobes with opposite phases, analogous to how a twodimensional wave has both parts above and below the average. We indicate the phases by shading the orbital lobes different colors. When orbital lobes of the same phase overlap, constructive wave interference increases the electron density. When regions of opposite phase overlap, the destructive wave interference decreases electron density and creates nodes. When  orbitals overlap end to end, they create σ and  orbitals (Figure 8.30). If two atoms are located along the  -axis in a Cartesian coordinate system, the two  orbitals overlap end to end and form  (bonding) and  (antibonding) (read as "sigma-p-x" and "sigma-p-x star," respectively). Just as with  -orbital overlap, the asterisk indicates the orbital with a node between the nuclei, which is a higher-energy, antibonding orbital.

  
FIGURE 8.30 Combining wave functions of two  atomic orbitals along the internuclear axis creates two molecular orbitals,  and 

The side-by-side overlap of two  orbitals gives rise to a pi (π) bonding molecular orbital and a  antibonding molecular orbital, as shown in Figure 8.31. In valence bond theory, we describe π bonds as containing a nodal plane containing the internuclear axis and perpendicular to the lobes of the  orbitals, with electron density on either side of the node. In molecular orbital theory, we describe the π orbital by this sameshape, and a π bond exists when this orbital contains electrons. Electrons in this orbital interact with both nuclei and help hold the two atoms together, making it a bonding orbital. For the out-of-phase combination, there are two nodal planes created, one along the internuclear axis and a perpendicular one between the nuclei.

  
FIGURE 8.31 Side-by-side overlap of each two  orbitals results in the formation of two π molecular orbitals. Combining the out-of-phase orbitals results in an antibonding molecular orbital with two nodes. One contains the internuclear axis, and one is perpendicular to the axis. Combining the in-phase orbitals results in a bonding orbital. There is a node (blue) containing the internuclear axis with the two lobes of the orbital located above and below this node.

In the molecular orbitals of diatomic molecules, each atom also has two sets of  orbitals oriented side by side  , so these four atomic orbitals combine pairwise to create two π orbitals and two  orbitals. The  and  orbitals are oriented at right angles to the  and  orbitals. Except for their orientation, the  and  orbitals are identical and have the same energy; they are degenerate orbitals. The  and  antibonding orbitals are also degenerate and identical except for their orientation. A total of six molecular orbitals results from the combination of the six atomic p orbitals in two atoms: σpx and πpy and πpz and

# Walter Kohn: Nobel Laureate

Walter Kohn (Figure 8.32) is a theoretical physicist who studies the electronic structure of solids. His work combines the principles of quantum mechanics with advanced mathematical techniques. This technique, called density functional theory, makes it possible to compute properties of molecular orbitals, including their shape and energies. Kohn and mathematician John Pople were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1998 for their contributions to our understanding of electronic structure. Kohn also made significant contributions to the physics of semiconductors.

Kohn’s biography has been remarkable outside the realm of physical chemistry as well. He was born in Austria, and during World War II he was part of the Kindertransport program that rescued 10,000 children from the Nazi regime. His summer jobs included discovering gold deposits in Canada and helping Polaroid explain how its instant film worked. Dr. Kohn passed away in 2016 at the age of 93.# HOW SCIENCES INTERCONNECT

# Computational Chemistry in Drug Design

While the descriptions of bonding described in this chapter involve many theoretical concepts, they also have many practical, real-world applications. For example, drug design is an important field that uses our understanding of chemical bonding to develop pharmaceuticals. This interdisciplinary area of study uses biology (understanding diseases and how they operate) to identify specific targets, such as a binding site that is involved in a disease pathway. By modeling the structures of the binding site and potential drugs, computational chemists can predict which structures can fit together and how effectively they will bind (see Figure 8.33). Thousands of potential candidates can be narrowed down to a few of the most promising candidates. These candidate molecules are then carefully tested to determine side effects, how effectively they can be transported through the body, and other factors. Dozens of important new pharmaceuticals have been discovered with the aid of computational chemistry, and new research projects are underway.

  
FIGURE 8.33 The molecule shown, HIV-1 protease, is an important target for pharmaceutical research. By designing molecules that bind to this protein, scientists are able to drastically inhibit the progress of the disease.

# Molecular Orbital Energy Diagrams

The relative energy levels of atomic and molecular orbitals are typically shown in a molecular orbital diagram (Figure 8.34). For a diatomic molecule, the atomic orbitals of one atom are shown on the left, and those of the other atom are shown on the right. Each horizontal line represents one orbital that can hold two electrons. The molecular orbitals formed by the combination of the atomic orbitals are shown in the center. Dashed lines show which of the atomic orbitals combine to form the molecular orbitals. For each pair of atomic orbitals that combine, one lower-energy (bonding) molecular orbital and one higher-energy (antibonding) orbital result. Thus we can see that combining the six  atomic orbitals results in three bonding orbitals (one σ and two π) and three antibonding orbitals (one  and two  ).

We predict the distribution of electrons in these molecular orbitals by filling the orbitals in the same way that we fill atomic orbitals, by the Aufbau principle. Lower-energy orbitals fill first, electrons spread out among degenerate orbitals before pairing, and each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins (Figure 8.34). Just as we write electron configurations for atoms, we can write the molecular electronic configuration by listing the orbitals with superscripts indicating the number of electrons present. For clarity, we place parentheses around molecular orbitals with the same energy. In this case, each orbital is at a different energy, so parentheses separate each orbital. Thus we would expect a diatomic molecule or ion containing seven electrons (such as  would have the molecular electron configuration  It is common to omit the core electrons from molecular orbital diagrams and configurations and include only the valence electrons.  
FIGURE 8.34 This is the molecular orbital diagram for the homonuclear diatomic  showing the molecular orbitals of the valence shell only. The molecular orbitals are filled in the same manner as atomic orbitals, using the Aufbau principle and Hund’s rule.

# Bond Order

The filled molecular orbital diagram shows the number of electrons in both bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals. The net contribution of the electrons to the bond strength of a molecule is identified by determining the bond order that results from the filling of the molecular orbitals by electrons.

When using Lewis structures to describe the distribution of electrons in molecules, we define bond order as the number of bonding pairs of electrons between two atoms. Thus a single bond has a bond order of 1, a double bond has a bond order of 2, and a triple bond has a bond order of 3. We define bond order differently when we use the molecular orbital description of the distribution of electrons, but the resulting bond order is usually the same. The MO technique is more accurate and can handle cases when the Lewis structure method fails, but both methods describe the same phenomenon.

In the molecular orbital model, an electron contributes to a bonding interaction if it occupies a bonding orbital and it contributes to an antibonding interaction if it occupies an antibonding orbital. The bond order is calculated by subtracting the destabilizing (antibonding) electrons from the stabilizing (bonding) electrons. Since a bond consists of two electrons, we divide by two to get the bond order. We can determine bond order with the following equation:

The order of a covalent bond is a guide to its strength; a bond between two given atoms becomes stronger as the bond order increases (Table 8.1). If the distribution of electrons in the molecular orbitals between two atoms is such that the resulting bond would have a bond order of zero, a stable bond does not form. We next look at some specific examples of MO diagrams and bond orders.

# Bonding in Diatomic Molecules

A dihydrogen molecule  forms from two hydrogen atoms. When the atomic orbitals of the two atoms combine, the electrons occupy the molecular orbital of lowest energy, the  bonding orbital. A dihydrogen molecule,  , readily forms because the energy of a  molecule is lower than that of two H atoms. The  orbital that contains both electrons is lower in energy than either of the two  atomic orbitals.

A molecular orbital can hold two electrons, so both electrons in the  molecule are in the  bonding orbital; the electron configuration is  We represent this configuration by a molecular orbital energy diagram (Figure 8.35) in which a single upward arrow indicates one electron in an orbital, and two (upward and downward) arrows indicate two electrons of opposite spin.  
FIGURE 8.35 The molecular orbital energy diagram predicts that  will be a stable molecule with lower energy than the separated atoms.

A dihydrogen molecule contains two bonding electrons and no antibonding electrons so we have



Because the bond order for the  bond is equal to 1, the bond is a single bond.

A helium atom has two electrons, both of which are in its  orbital. Two helium atoms do not combine to form a dihelium molecule,  , with four electrons, because the stabilizing effect of the two electrons in the lowerenergy bonding orbital would be offset by the destabilizing effect of the two electrons in the higher-energy antibonding molecular orbital. We would write the hypothetical electron configuration of  as  as in Figure 8.36. The net energy change would be zero, so there is no driving force for helium atoms to form the diatomic molecule. In fact, helium exists as discrete atoms rather than as diatomic molecules. The bond order in a hypothetical dihelium molecule would be zero.



A bond order of zero indicates that no bond is formed between two atoms.

  
FIGURE 8.36 The molecular orbital energy diagram predicts that  will not be a stable molecule, since it has equal numbers of bonding and antibonding electrons.

# The Diatomic Molecules of the Second Period

Eight possible homonuclear diatomic molecules might be formed by the atoms of the second period of the periodic table: Li2,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  . However, we can predict that the  molecule and the  molecule would not be stable. We can see this by a consideration of the molecular electron configurations (Table 8.3).

We predict valence molecular orbital electron configurations just as we predict electron configurations of atoms. Valence electrons are assigned to valence molecular orbitals with the lowest possible energies.Consistent with Hund’s rule, whenever there are two or more degenerate molecular orbitals, electrons fill each orbital of that type singly before any pairing of electrons takes place.

As we saw in valence bond theory, σ bonds are generally more stable than π bonds formed from degenerate atomic orbitals. Similarly, in molecular orbital theory,  orbitals are usually more stable than π orbitals. However, this is not always the case. The MOs for the valence orbitals of the second period are shown in Figure 8.37. Looking at  molecular orbitals, we see that the order is consistent with the generic diagram shown in the previous section. However, for atoms with three or fewer electrons in the  orbitals (Li through N) we observe a different pattern, in which the  orbital is higher in energy than the  set. Obtain the molecular orbital diagram for a homonuclear diatomic ion by adding or subtracting electrons from the diagram for the neutral molecule.

  
FIGURE 8.37 This shows the MO diagrams for each homonuclear diatomic molecule in the second period. The orbital energies decrease across the period as the effective nuclear charge increases and atomic radius decreases. Between  and  , the order of the orbitals changes.

This switch in orbital ordering occurs because of a phenomenon called s-p mixing. s-p mixing does not create new orbitals; it merely influences the energies of the existing molecular orbitals. The  wavefunction mathematically combines with the  wavefunction, with the result that the  orbital becomes more stable, and the  orbital becomes less stable (Figure 8.38). Similarly, the antibonding orbitals also undergo s-p mixing, with the  becoming more stable and the  becoming less stable.  
FIGURE 8.38 Without mixing, the MO pattern occurs as expected, with the  orbital lower in energy than the  orbitals. When s-p mixing occurs, the orbitals shift as shown, with the  orbital higher in energy than the  orbitals.

s-p mixing occurs when the  and  orbitals have similar energies. The energy difference between  and  orbitals in O, F, and Ne is greater than that in Li, Be, B, C, and N. Because of this,  , and  exhibit negligible  mixing (not sufficient to change the energy ordering), and their MO diagrams follow the normal pattern, as shown in Figure 8.37. All of the other period 2 diatomic molecules do have s-p mixing, which leads to the pattern where the  orbital is raised above the  set.

Using the MO diagrams shown in Figure 8.37, we can add in the electrons and determine the molecular electron configuration and bond order for each of the diatomic molecules. As shown in Table 8.3,  and  molecules would have a bond order of 0, and these molecules do not exist.

The combination of two lithium atoms to form a lithium molecule,  , is analogous to the formation of  , but the atomic orbitals involved are the valence  orbitals. Each of the two lithium atoms has one valence electron. Hence, we have two valence electrons available for the  bonding molecular orbital. Because both valence electrons would be in a bonding orbital, we would predict the  molecule to be stable. The molecule is, in fact, present in appreciable concentration in lithium vapor at temperatures near the boiling point of the element. All of the other molecules in Table 8.3 with a bond order greater than zero are also known.

The  molecule has enough electrons to half fill the  level. We expect the two electrons that occupy these two degenerate orbitals to be unpaired, and this molecular electronic configuration for  is in accord with the fact that the oxygen molecule has two unpaired electrons (Figure 8.40). The presence of two unpaired electrons has proved to be difficult to explain using Lewis structures, but the molecular orbital theory explains it quite well. In fact, the unpaired electrons of the oxygen molecule provide a strong piece of support for the molecular orbital theory.

# HOW SCIENCES INTERCONNECT

# Band Theory

When two identical atomic orbitals on different atoms combine, two molecular orbitals result (see Figure 8.29). The bonding orbital is lower in energy than the original atomic orbitals because the atomic orbitals are inphase in the molecular orbital. The antibonding orbital is higher in energy than the original atomic orbitals because the atomic orbitals are out-of-phase.

In a solid, similar things happen, but on a much larger scale. Remember that even in a small sample there are a huge number of atoms (typically  atoms), and therefore a huge number of atomic orbitals that may be combined into molecular orbitals. When  valence atomic orbitals, all of the same energy and each containing one (1) electron, are combined,  (filled) bonding orbitals and  (empty) antibonding orbitals will result. Each bonding orbital will show an energy lowering as the atomic orbitals are mostly in-phase, but each of the bonding orbitals will be a little different and have slightly different energies. The antibonding orbitals will show an increase in energy as the atomic orbitals are mostly out-of-phase, but each of the antibonding orbitals will also be a little different and have slightly different energies. The allowed energy levels for all the bonding orbitals are so close together that they form a band, called the valence band. Likewise, all the antibonding orbitals are very close together and form a band, called the conduction band. Figure 8.39 shows the bands for three important classes of materials: insulators, semiconductors, and conductors.  
FIGURE 8.39 Molecular orbitals in solids are so closely spaced that they are described as bands. The valence band is lower in energy and the conduction band is higher in energy. The type of solid is determined by the size of the “band gap” between the valence and conduction bands. Only a very small amount of energy is required to move electrons from the valence band to the conduction band in a conductor, and so they conduct electricity well. In an insulator, the band gap is large, so that very few electrons move, and they are poor conductors of electricity. Semiconductors are in between: they conduct electricity better than insulators, but not as well as conductors.

In order to conduct electricity, electrons must move from the filled valence band to the empty conduction band where they can move throughout the solid. The size of the band gap, or the energy difference between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band, determines how easy it is to move electrons between the bands. Only a small amount of energy is required in a conductor because the band gap is very small. This small energy difference is “easy” to overcome, so they are good conductors of electricity. In an insulator, the band gap is so “large” that very few electrons move into the conduction band; as a result, insulators are poor conductors of electricity. Semiconductors conduct electricity when “moderate” amounts of energy are provided to move electrons out of the valence band and into the conduction band. Semiconductors, such as silicon, are found in many electronics.

Semiconductors are used in devices such as computers, smartphones, and solar cells. Solar cells produce electricity when light provides the energy to move electrons out of the valence band. The electricity that is generated may then be used to power a light or tool, or it can be stored for later use by charging a battery. As of December 2014, up to  of the energy in sunlight could be converted into electricity using solar cells.

# Key Equations

2# Summary

# 8.1 Valence Bond Theory

Valence bond theory describes bonding as a consequence of the overlap of two separate atomic orbitals on different atoms that creates a region with one pair of electrons shared between the two atoms. When the orbitals overlap along an axis containing the nuclei, they form a σ bond. When they overlap in a fashion that creates a node along this axis, they form a π bond.

# 8.2 Hybrid Atomic Orbitals

We can use hybrid orbitals, which are mathematical combinations of some or all of the valence atomic orbitals, to describe the electron density around covalently bonded atoms. These hybrid orbitals either form sigma (σ) bonds directed toward other atoms of the molecule or contain lone pairs of electrons. We can determine the type of hybridization around a central atom from the geometry of the regions of electron density about it. Two such regions imply sp hybridization; three,  hybridization; four,  hybridization; five,  hybridization; and six,  hybridization. Pi (π) bonds are formed from unhybridized atomic orbitals (  or  orbitals).

# 8.3 Multiple Bonds

Multiple bonds consist of a σ bond located along the axis between two atoms and one or two π bonds. The σ bonds are usually formed by the overlap of hybridized atomic orbitals, while the π bonds are formed by the side-by-side overlap of unhybridized orbitals. Resonance occurs when there are multiple unhybridized orbitals with the appropriate alignment to overlap, so the placement of π bonds can vary.

# 8.4 Molecular Orbital Theory

Molecular orbital (MO) theory describes the behavior of electrons in a molecule in terms of combinations of the atomic wave functions. The resulting molecular orbitals may extend over all the atoms in the molecule. Bonding molecular orbitals are formed by in-phase combinations of atomic wave functions, and electrons in these orbitals stabilize a molecule. Antibonding molecular orbitals result from out-of-phase combinations of atomic wave functions and electrons in these orbitals make a molecule less stable. Molecular orbitals located along an internuclear axis are called  MOs. They can be formed from  orbitals or from  orbitals oriented in an end-to-end fashion. Molecular orbitals formed from  orbitals oriented in a sideby-side fashion have electron density on opposite sides of the internuclear axis and are called π orbitals.

We can describe the electronic structure of diatomic molecules by applying molecular orbital theory to the valence electrons of the atoms. Electrons fill molecular orbitals following the same rules that apply to filling atomic orbitals; Hund’s rule and the Aufbau principle tell us that lower-energy orbitals will fill first, electrons will spread out before they pair up, and each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins. Materials with unpaired electrons are paramagnetic and attracted to a magnetic field, while those with all-paired electrons are diamagnetic and repelled by a magnetic field. Correctly predicting the magnetic properties of molecules is in advantage of molecular orbital theory over Lewis structures and valence bond theory.
