INTRODUCTION TO RADIOACTIVITY AND NUCLEAR PHYSICS There is an ongoing quest to find substructures of matter. At one time, it was thought that atoms would be the ultimate substructure, but just when the first direct evidence of atoms was obtained, it became clear that they have a substructure and a tiny nucleus. The nucleus itself has spectacular characteristics. For example, certain nuclei are unstable, and their decay emits radiations with energies millions of times greater than atomic energies. Some of the mysteries of nature, such as why the core of the earth remains molten and how the sun produces its energy, are explained by nuclear phenomena. The exploration of ivinhucl evlnmenalpevsly partcn laws. That exploration has evolved into a search for further underlying structures, such as quarks. In this chapter, the fundamentals of nuclear radioactivity and the nucleus are explored. The following two chapters explore the more important applications of nuclear physics in the field of medicine. We will also explore the basics of what we know about quarks and other substructures smaller than nuclei.# 31.1 Nuclear Radioactivity

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Explain nuclear radiation.   
Explain the types of radiation—alpha emission, beta emission, and gamma emission.   
Explain the ionization of radiation in an atom.   
Define the range of radiation.

The discovery and study of nuclear radioactivity quickly revealed evidence of revolutionary new physics. In addition, uses for nuclear radiation also emerged quickly—for example, people such as Ernest Rutherford used it to determine the size of the nucleus and devices were painted with radon-doped paint to make them glow in the dark (see Figure 31.2). We therefore begin our study of nuclear physics with the discovery and basic features of nuclear radioactivity.

# Discovery of Nuclear Radioactivity

In 1896, the French physicist Antoine Henri Becquerel (1852–1908) accidentally found that a uranium-rich mineral called pitchblende emits invisible, penetrating rays that can darken a photographic plate enclosed in an opaque envelope. The rays therefore carry energy; but amazingly, the pitchblende emits them continuously without any energy input. This is an apparent violation of the law of conservation of energy, one that we now understand is due to the conversion of a small amount of mass into energy, as related in Einstein’s famous equation  . It was soon evident that Becquerel’s rays originate in the nuclei of the atoms and have other unique characteristics. The emission of these rays is called nuclear radioactivity or simply radioactivity. The rays themselves are called nuclear radiation. A nucleus that spontaneously destroys part of its mass to emit radiation is said to decay (a term also used to describe the emission of radiation by atoms in excited states). A substance or object that emits nuclear radiation is said to be radioactive.

Two types of experimental evidence imply that Becquerel’s rays originate deep in the heart (or nucleus) of an atom. First, the radiation is found to be associated with certain elements, such as uranium. Radiation does not vary with chemical state—that is, uranium is radioactive whether it is in the form of an element or compound. In addition, radiation does not vary with temperature, pressure, or ionization state of the uranium atom. Since all of these factors affect electrons in an atom, the radiation cannot come from electron transitions, as atomic spectra do. The huge energy emitted during each event is the second piece of evidence that the radiation cannot be atomic. Nuclear radiation has energies of the order of  per event, which is much greater than the typical atomic energies (a few ), such as that observed in spectra and chemical reactions, and more than ten times as high as the most energetic characteristic  rays. Becquerel did not vigorously pursue his discovery for very long. In 1898, Marie Curie (1867–1934), then a graduate student married to the already well-known French physicist Pierre Curie (1859–1906), began her doctoral study of Becquerel’s rays. She and her husband soon discovered two new radioactive elements, which she named polonium (after her native land) and radium (because it radiates). These two new elements filled holes in the periodic table and, further, displayed much higher levels of radioactivity per gram of material than uranium. Over a period of four years, working under poor conditions and spending their own funds, the Curies processed more than a ton of uranium ore to isolate a gram of radium salt. Radium became highly soughtafter, because it was about two million times as radioactive as uranium. Curie’s radium salt glowed visibly from the radiation that took its toll on them and other unaware researchers. Shortly after completing her Ph.D., both Curies and Becquerel shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in physics for their work on radioactivity. Pierre was killed in a horse cart accident in 1906, but Marie continued her study of radioactivity for nearly 30 more years. Awarded the 1911 Nobel Prize in chemistry for her discovery of two new elements, she remains the only person to win Nobel Prizes in physics and chemistry. Marie’s radioactive fingerprints on some pages of her notebooks can still expose film, and she suffered from radiation-induced lesions. She died of leukemia likely caused by radiation, but she was active in research almost until her death in 1934. The following year, her daughter and son-in-law, Irene and Frederic JoliotCurie, were awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry for their discovery of artificially induced radiation, adding to a remarkable family legacy.

# Alpha, Beta, and Gamma

Research begun by people such as New Zealander Ernest Rutherford soon after the discovery of nuclear radiation indicated that different types of rays are emitted. Eventually, three types were distinguished and named alpha  , beta  , and gamma , because, like x-rays, their identities were initially unknown. Figure 31.3 shows what happens if the rays are passed through a magnetic field. The s are unaffected, while the  and  are deflected in opposite directions, indicating the  s are positive, the  s negative, and the s uncharged. Rutherford used both magnetic and electric fields to show that  s have a positive charge twice the magnitude of an electron, or  . In the process, he found the  s charge to mass ratio to be several thousand times smaller than the electron’s. Later on, Rutherford collected  s from a radioactive source and passed an electric discharge through them, obtaining the spectrum of recently discovered helium gas. Among many important discoveries made by Rutherford and his collaborators was the proof that  radiation is the emission of a helium nucleus. Rutherford won the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1908 for his early work. He continued to make important contributions until his death in 1934.

  
FIGURE 31.3 Alpha, beta, and gamma rays are passed through a magnetic field on the way to a phosphorescent screen. The  s and  s bend in opposite directions, while the s are unaffected, indicating a positive charge for  s, negative for  , and neutral for  . Consistent results are obtained with electric fields. Collection of the radiation offers further confirmation from the direct measurement of excess charge.

Other researchers had already proved that  s are negative and have the same mass and same charge-to-mass ratio as the recently discovered electron. By 1902, it was recognized that  radiation is the emission of an electron. Although  s are electrons, they do not exist in the nucleus before it decays and are not ejected atomic electrons—the electron is created in the nucleus at the instant of decay.

Since s remain unaffected by electric and magnetic fields, it is natural to think they might be photons. Evidence forthis grew, but it was not until 1914 that this was proved by Rutherford and collaborators. By scattering radiation from a crystal and observing interference, they demonstrated that radiation is the emission of a high-energy de-excitation of an atom. The names " ray" and  ray" identify the source of the radiation. At the same energy, rays and x rays are otherwise identical.

# Ionization and Range

Two of the most important characteristics of  and  rays were recognized very early. All three types of nuclear radiation produce ionization in materials, but they penetrate different distances in materials—that is, they have different ranges. Let us examine why they have these characteristics and what are some of the consequences.

Like x rays, nuclear radiation in the form of  s,  s, and s has enough energy per event to ionize atoms and molecules in any material. The energy emitted in various nuclear decays ranges from a few to more than  , while only a few are needed to produce ionization. The effects of  rays and nuclear radiation on biological tissues and other materials, such as solid state electronics, are directly related to the ionization they produce. All of them, for example, can damage electronics or kill cancer cells. In addition, methods for detecting x rays and nuclear radiation are based on ionization, directly or indirectly. All of them can ionize the air between the plates of a capacitor, for example, causing it to discharge. This is the basis of inexpensive personal radiation monitors, such as pictured in Figure 31.4. Apart from  ,  , and , there are other forms of nuclear radiation as well, and these also produce ionization with similar effects. We define ionizing radiation as any form of radiation that produces ionization whether nuclear in origin or not, since the effects and detection of the radiation are related to ionization.

  
FIGURE 31.4 These dosimeters (literally, dose meters) are personal radiation monitors that detect the amount of radiation by the discharge of a rechargeable internal capacitor. The amount of discharge is related to the amount of ionizing radiation encountered, a measurement of dose. One dosimeter is shown in the charger. Its scale is read through an eyepiece on the top.

The range of radiation is defined to be the distance it can travel through a material. Range is related to several factors, including the energy of the radiation, the material encountered, and the type of radiation (see Figure 31.5). The higher the energy, the greater the range, all other factors being the same. This makes good sense, since radiation loses its energy in materials primarily by producing ionization in them, and each ionization of an atom or a molecule requires energy that is removed from the radiation. The amount of ionization is, thus, directly proportional to the energy of the particle of radiation, as is its range.  
FIGURE 31.5 The penetration or range of radiation depends on its energy, the material it encounters, and the type of radiation. (a) Greater energy means greater range. (b) Radiation has a smaller range in materials with high electron density. (c) Alphas have the smallest range, betas have a greater range, and gammas penetrate the farthest.

Radiation can be absorbed or shielded by materials, such as the lead aprons dentists drape on us when taking x rays. Lead is a particularly effective shield compared with other materials, such as plastic or air. How does the range of radiation depend on material? Ionizing radiation interacts best with charged particles in a material. Since electrons have small masses, they most readily absorb the energy of the radiation in collisions. The greater the density of a material and, in particular, the greater the density of electrons within a material, the smaller the range of radiation.

# Collisions

Conservation of energy and momentum often results in energy transfer to a less massive object in a collision.   
This was discussed in detail in Work, Energy, and Energy Resources, for example.

Different types of radiation have different ranges when compared at the same energy and in the same material. Alphas have the shortest range, betas penetrate farther, and gammas have the greatest range. This is directly related to charge and speed of the particle or type of radiation. At a given energy, each  ,  or will produce the same number of ionizations in a material (each ionization requires a certain amount of energy on average). The more readily the particle produces ionization, the more quickly it will lose its energy. The effect of charge is as follows: The  has a charge of  , the  has a charge of  , and the is uncharged. The electromagnetic force exerted by the  is thus twice as strong as that exerted by the  and it is more likely to produce ionization. Although chargeless, the does interact weakly because it is an electromagnetic wave, but it is less likely to produce ionization in any encounter. More quantitatively, the change in momentum  given to a particle in the material is  , where  is the force the  ,  , or exerts over a time  . The smaller the charge, the smaller is  and the smaller is the momentum (and energy) lost. Since the speed of alphas is about  to  of the speed of light, classical (nonrelativistic) formulas apply.

The speed at which they travel is the other major factor affecting the range of  s,  , and s. The faster they move, the less time they spend in the vicinity of an atom or a molecule, and the less likely they are to interact. Since  s and  are particles with mass (helium nuclei and electrons, respectively), their energy is kinetic, given classically by  . The mass of the  particle is thousands of times less than that of the  s, so that  s must travel much faster than  to have the same energy. Since  s move faster (most at relativistic speeds), they have less time to interact than  s. Gamma rays are photons, which must travel at the speed of light. They are even less likely to interact than a  , since they spend even less time near a given atom (and they have no charge). The range of s is thus greater than the range of  .

Alpha radiation from radioactive sources has a range much less than a millimeter of biological tissues, usually not enough to even penetrate the dead layers of our skin. On the other hand, the same  radiation can penetrate a fewcentimeters of air, so mere distance from a source prevents  radiation from reaching us. This makes  radiation relatively safe for our body compared to  and  radiation. Typical  radiation can penetrate a few millimeters of tissue or about a meter of air. Beta radiation is thus hazardous even when not ingested. The range of  in lead is about a millimeter, and so it is easy to store  sources in lead radiation-proof containers. Gamma rays have a much greater range than either s or  . In fact, if a given thickness of material, like a lead brick, absorbs  of the s, then a second lead brick will only absorb  of what got through the first. Thus, s do not have a well-defined range; we can only cut down the amount that gets through. Typically, s can penetrate many meters of air, go right through our bodies, and are effectively shielded (that is, reduced in intensity to acceptable levels) by many centimeters of lead. One benefit of s is that they can be used as radioactive tracers (see Figure 31.6).

A short-lived radioactive substance that locates itself selectively is given to the patient, and the radiation is measured with an external detector. The emitted radiation has a sufficient range to leave the body—the range of  s and  s is too small for them to be observed outside the patient. (credit: Kieran Maher, Wikimedia Commons)

# 31.2 Radiation Detection and Detectors

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Explain the working principle of a Geiger tube.   
Define and discuss radiation detectors.

It is well known that ionizing radiation affects us but does not trigger nerve impulses. Newspapers carry stories about unsuspecting victims of radiation poisoning who fall ill with radiation sickness, such as burns and blood count changes, but who never felt the radiation directly. This makes the detection of radiation by instruments more than an important research tool. This section is a brief overview of radiation detection and some of its applications.

# Human Application

The first direct detection of radiation was Becquerel’s fogged photographic plate. Photographic film is still the most common detector of ionizing radiation, being used routinely in medical and dental x rays. Nuclear radiation is also captured on film, such as seen in Figure 31.7. The mechanism for film exposure by ionizing radiation is similar to that by photons. A quantum of energy interacts with the emulsion and alters it chemically, thus exposing the film. The quantum come from an  -particle,  -particle, or photon, provided it has more than the few eV of energy neededto induce the chemical change (as does all ionizing radiation). The process is not  efficient, since not all incident radiation interacts and not all interactions produce the chemical change. The amount of film darkening is related to exposure, but the darkening also depends on the type of radiation, so that absorbers and other devices must be used to obtain energy, charge, and particle-identification information.

  
FIGURE 31.7 Film badges contain film similar to that used in this dental x-ray film and is sandwiched between various absorbers to determine the penetrating ability of the radiation as well as the amount. (credit: Werneuchen, Wikimedia Commons)

Another very common radiation detector is the Geiger tube. The clicking and buzzing sound we hear in dramatizations and documentaries, as well as in our own physics labs, is usually an audio output of events detected by a Geiger counter. These relatively inexpensive radiation detectors are based on the simple and sturdy Geiger tube, shown schematically in Figure 31.8(b). A conducting cylinder with a wire along its axis is filled with an insulating gas so that a voltage applied between the cylinder and wire produces almost no current. Ionizing radiation passing through the tube produces free ion pairs (each pair consisting of one positively charged particle and one negatively charged particle) that are attracted to the wire and cylinder, forming a current that is detected as a count. The word count implies that there is no information on energy, charge, or type of radiation with a simple Geiger counter. They do not detect every particle, since some radiation can pass through without producing enough ionization to be detected. However, Geiger counters are very useful in producing a prompt output that reveals the existence and relative intensity of ionizing radiation.  
FIGURE 31.8 (a) Geiger counters such as this one are used for prompt monitoring of radiation levels, generally giving only relative intensity and not identifying the type or energy of the radiation. (credit: TimVickers, Wikimedia Commons) (b) Voltage applied between the cylinder and wire in a Geiger tube causes ions and electrons produced by radiation passing through the gas-filled cylinder to move towards them. The resulting current is detected and registered as a count.

Another radiation detection method records light produced when radiation interacts with materials. The energy of the radiation is sufficient to excite atoms in a material that may fluoresce, such as the phosphor used by Rutherford’s group. Materials called scintillators use a more complex collaborative process to convert radiation energy into light. Scintillators may be liquid or solid, and they can be very efficient. Their light output can provide information about the energy, charge, and type of radiation. Scintillator light flashes are very brief in duration, enabling the detection of a huge number of particles in short periods of time. Scintillator detectors are used in a variety of research and diagnostic applications. Among these are the detection by satellite-mounted equipment of the radiation from distant galaxies, the analysis of radiation from a person indicating body burdens, and the detection of exotic particles in accelerator laboratories.

Light from a scintillator is converted into electrical signals by devices such as the photomultiplier tube shown schematically in Figure 31.9. These tubes are based on the photoelectric effect, which is multiplied in stages into a cascade of electrons, hence the name photomultiplier. Light entering the photomultiplier strikes a metal plate, ejecting an electron that is attracted by a positive potential difference to the next plate, giving it enough energy to eject two or more electrons, and so on. The final output current can be made proportional to the energy of the light entering the tube, which is in turn proportional to the energy deposited in the scintillator. Very sophisticated information can be obtained with scintillators, including energy, charge, particle identification, direction of motion, and so on.  
FIGURE 31.9 Photomultipliers use the photoelectric effect on the photocathode to convert the light output of a scintillator into an electrical signal. Each successive dynode has a more-positive potential than the last and attracts the ejected electrons, giving them more energy. The number of electrons is thus multiplied at each dynode, resulting in an easily detected output current.

Solid-state radiation detectors convert ionization produced in a semiconductor (like those found in computer chips) directly into an electrical signal. Semiconductors can be constructed that do not conduct current in one particular direction. When a voltage is applied in that direction, current flows only when ionization is produced by radiation, similar to what happens in a Geiger tube. Further, the amount of current in a solid-state detector is closely related to the energy deposited and, since the detector is solid, it can have a high efficiency (since ionizing radiation is stopped in a shorter distance in solids fewer particles escape detection). As with scintillators, very sophisticated information can be obtained from solid-state detectors.

Define and discuss isotopes.   
Calculate the density of the nucleus.   
Explain nuclear force.

What is inside the nucleus? Why are some nuclei stable while others decay? (See Figure 31.10.) Why are there different types of decay  and )? Why are nuclear decay energies so large? Pursuing natural questions like these has led to far more fundamental discoveries than you might imagine.

  
FIGURE 31.10 Why is most of the carbon in this coal stable (a), while the uranium in the disk (b) slowly decays over billions of years?

We have already identified protons as the particles that carry positive charge in the nuclei. However, there are actually two types of particles in the nuclei—the proton and the neutron, referred to collectively as nucleons, the constituents of nuclei. As its name implies, the neutron is a neutral particle  ) that has nearly the same mass and intrinsic spin as the proton. Table 31.2 compares the masses of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Note how close the proton and neutron masses are, but the neutron is slightly more massive once you look past the third digit. Both nucleons are much more massive than an electron. In fact,  (as noted in Medical Applications of Nuclear Physics and  .

Table 31.2 also gives masses in terms of mass units that are more convenient than kilograms on the atomic and nuclear scale. The first of these is the unified atomic mass unit (u), defined as



This unit is defined so that a neutral carbon  atom has a mass of exactly  . Masses are also expressed in units of  . These units are very convenient when considering the conversion of mass into energy (and vice versa), as is so prominent in nuclear processes. Using  and units of  in  , we find that  cancels and  comes out conveniently in MeV. For example, if the rest mass of a proton is converted entirely into energy, then



It is useful to note that 1 u of mass converted to energy produces 931.5 MeV, or



All properties of a nucleus are determined by the number of protons and neutrons it has. A specific combination of protons and neutrons is called a nuclide and is a unique nucleus. The following notation is used to represent a particular nuclide:



where the symbols  , ,  , and  are defined as follows: The number of protons in a nucleus is the atomic number  , as defined in Medical Applications of Nuclear Physics. X is the symbol for the element, such as Ca for calcium. However, once  is known, the element is known; hence,  and  are redundant. For example,  is always calcium, and calcium always has  .  is the number of neutrons in a nucleus. In the notation for a nuclide, the subscript  is usually omitted. The symbol  is defined as the number of nucleons or the total number

where  is also called the mass number. This name for  is logical; the mass of an atom is nearly equal to the mass of its nucleus, since electrons have so little mass. The mass of the nucleus turns out to be nearly equal to the sum of the masses of the protons and neutrons in it, which is proportional to  . In this context, it is particularly convenient to express masses in units of u. Both protons and neutrons have masses close to  , and so the mass of an atom is close to  . For example, in an oxygen nucleus with eight protons and eight neutrons,  , and its mass is  . As noticed, the unified atomic mass unit is defined so that a neutral carbon atom (actually a  atom) has a mass of exactly  . Carbon was chosen as the standard, partly because of its importance in organic chemistry (see Appendix A).

Let us look at a few examples of nuclides expressed in the  notation. The nucleus of the simplest atom, hydrogen, is a single proton, or  (the zero for no neutrons is often omitted). To check this symbol, refer to the periodic table—you see that the atomic number  of hydrogen is 1. Since you are given that there are no neutrons, the mass number  is also 1. Suppose you are told that the helium nucleus or  particle has two protons and two neutrons. You can then see that it is written  . There is a scarce form of hydrogen found in nature called deuterium; its nucleus has one proton and one neutron and, hence, twice the mass of common hydrogen. The symbol for deuterium is, thus,  (sometimes is used, as for deuterated water  ). An even rarer—and radioactive—form of hydrogen is called tritium, since it has a single proton and two neutrons, and it is written  . These three varieties of hydrogen have nearly identical chemistries, but the nuclei differ greatly in mass, stability, and other characteristics. Nuclei (such as those of hydrogen) having the same  and different  s are defined to be isotopes of the same element.

There is some redundancy in the symbols  , and  . If the element  is known, then  can be found in a periodic table and is always the same for a given element. If both  and  are known, then  can also be determined (first find  ; then,  . Thus the simpler notation for nuclides is



which is sufficient and is most commonly used. For example, in this simpler notation, the three isotopes of hydrogen are  and  while the  particle is  . We read this backward, saying helium-4 for  , or uranium-238 for  . So for  , should we need to know, we can determine that  for uranium from the periodic table, and, thus,  .

A variety of experiments indicate that a nucleus behaves something like a tightly packed ball of nucleons, as illustrated in Figure 31.11. These nucleons have large kinetic energies and, thus, move rapidly in very close contact. Nucleons can be separated by a large force, such as in a collision with another nucleus, but resist strongly being pushed closer together. The most compelling evidence that nucleons are closely packed in a nucleus is that the radius of a nucleus,  , is found to be given approximately by



where  and  is the mass number of the nucleus. Note that  . Since many nuclei are spherical, and the volume of a sphere is  , we see that  —that is, the volume of a nucleus is proportional tothe number of nucleons in it. This is what would happen if you pack nucleons so closely that there is no empty space between them.



FIGURE 31.11 A model of the nucleus.

Nucleons are held together by nuclear forces and resist both being pulled apart and pushed inside one another. The volume of the nucleus is the sum of the volumes of the nucleons in it, here shown in different colors to represent protons and neutrons.

# Discussion

(a) The radius of this medium-sized nucleus is found to be approximately  , and so its diameter is about  , or  . In our discussion of Rutherford’s discovery of the nucleus, we noticed that it is about  in diameter (which is for lighter nuclei), consistent with this result to an order of magnitude. The nucleus is much smaller in diameter than the typical atom, which has a diameter of the order of  .(b) The density found here is so large as to cause disbelief. It is consistent with earlier discussions we have had about the nucleus being very small and containing nearly all of the mass of the atom. Nuclear densities, such as found here, are about  times greater than that of water, which has a density of “only”  . One cubic meter of nuclear matter, such as found in a neutron star, has the same mass as a cube of water  on a side.

# Nuclear Forces and Stability

What forces hold a nucleus together? The nucleus is very small and its protons, being positive, exert tremendous repulsive forces on one another. (The Coulomb force increases as charges get closer, since it is proportional to  , even at the tiny distances found in nuclei.) The answer is that two previously unknown forces hold the nucleus together and make it into a tightly packed ball of nucleons. These forces are called the weak and strong nuclear fm. However, like glue, they are strongly attracted when the nucleons get close to one another. The strong nuclear force is about 100 times more attractive than the repulsive EM force, easily holding the nucleons together. Nuclear forces become extremely repulsive if the nucleons get too close, making nucleons strongly resist being pushed inside one another, something like ball bearings.

The fact that nuclear forces are very strong is responsible for the very large energies emitted in nuclear decay. During decay, the forces do work, and since work is force times the distance  ), a large force can result in a large emitted energy. In fact, we know that there are two distinct nuclear forces because of the different types of nuclear decay—the strong nuclear force is responsible for  decay, while the weak nuclear force is responsible for  decay.

The many stable and unstable nuclei we have explored, and the hundreds we have not discussed, can be arranged in a table called the chart of the nuclides, a simplified version of which is shown in Figure 31.12. Nuclides are located on a plot of  versus  . Examination of a detailed chart of the nuclides reveals patterns in the characteristics of nuclei, such as stability, abundance, and types of decay, analogous to but more complex than the systematics in the periodic table of the elements.

  
FIGURE 31.12 Simplified chart of the nuclides, a graph of  versus  for known nuclides. The patterns of stable and unstable nuclides reveal characteristics of the nuclear forces. The dashed line is for  . Numbers along diagonals are mass numbers .

In principle, a nucleus can have any combination of protons and neutrons, but Figure 31.12 shows a definite pattern for those that are stable. For low-mass nuclei, there is a strong tendency for  and  to be nearly equal. This means that the nuclear force is more attractive when  . More detailed examination reveals greater stabilitywhen  and  are even numbers—nuclear forces are more attractive when neutrons and protons are in pairs. For increasingly higher masses, there are progressively more neutrons than protons in stable nuclei. This is due to the ever-growing repulsion between protons. Since nuclear forces are short ranged, and the Coulomb force is long ranged, an excess of neutrons keeps the protons a little farther apart, reducing Coulomb repulsion. Decay modes of nuclides out of the region of stability consistently produce nuclides closer to the region of stability. There are more stable nuclei having certain numbers of protons and neutrons, called magic numbers. Magic numbers indicate a shell structure for the nucleus in which closed shells are more stable. Nuclear shell theory has been very successful in explaining nuclear energy levels, nuclear decay, and the greater stability of nuclei with closed shells. We have been producing ever-heavier transuranic elements since the early 1940s, and we have now produced the element with  . There are theoretical predictions of an island of relative stability for nuclei with such high  .

This successful nuclear model has nucleons filling shells analogous to electron shells in atoms. It was inspired by patterns observed in nuclear properties.

# 31.4 Nuclear Decay and Conservation Laws

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Define and discuss nuclear decay.   
State the conservation laws.   
Explain parent and daughter nucleus.   
Calculate the energy emitted during nuclear decay.

Nuclear decay has provided an amazing window into the realm of the very small. Nuclear decay gave the first indication of the connection between mass and energy, and it revealed the existence of two of the four basic forces in nature. In this section, we explore the major modes of nuclear decay; and, like those who first explored them, we will discover evidence of previously unknown particles and conservation laws.

Some nuclides are stable, apparently living forever. Unstable nuclides decay (that is, they are radioactive), eventually producing a stable nuclide after many decays. We call the original nuclide the parent and its decay products the daughters. Some radioactive nuclides decay in a single step to a stable nucleus. For example,  is unstable and decays directly to  , which is stable. Others, such as  , decay to another unstable nuclide, resulting in a decay series in which each subsequent nuclide decays until a stable nuclide is finally produced. The decay series that starts from  is of particular interest, since it produces the radioactive isotopes  and  , which the Curies first discovered (see Figure 31.14). Radon gas is also produced (  in the series), an increasingly recognized naturally occurring hazard. Since radon is a noble gas, it emanates from materials, such as soil, containing even trace amounts of  and can be inhaled. The decay of radon and its daughters produces internal damage. The  decay series ends with  , a stable isotope of lead.  
FIGURE 31.14 The decay series produced by  , the most common uranium isotope. Nuclides are graphed in the same manner as in the chart of nuclides. The type of decay for each member of the series is shown, as well as the half-lives. Note that some nuclides decay by more than one mode. You can see why radium and polonium are found in uranium ore. A stable isotope of lead is the end product of the series.

Note that the daughters of  decay shown in Figure 31.14 always have two fewer protons and two fewer neutrons than the parent. This seems reasonable, since we know that  decay is the emission of a  nucleus, which has two protons and two neutrons. The daughters of  decay have one less neutron and one more proton than their parent. Beta decay is a little more subtle, as we shall see. No decays are shown in the figure, because they do not produce a daughter that differs from the parent.

# Alpha Decay

In alpha decay, a  nucleus simply breaks away from the parent nucleus, leaving a daughter with two fewer protons and two fewer neutrons than the parent (see Figure 31.15). One example of  decay is shown in Figure 31.14 for  . Another nuclide that undergoes  decay is  . The decay equations for these two nuclides are



and

  
FIGURE 31.15 Alpha decay is the separation of a  nucleus from the parent. The daughter nucleus has two fewer protons and two fewe neutrons than the parent. Alpha decay occurs spontaneously only if the daughter and  nucleus have less total mass than the parent.

If you examine the periodic table of the elements, you will find that Th has  , two fewer than U, which has  . Similarly, in the second decay equation, we see that U has two fewer protons than  , which has  . The general rule for  decay is best written in the format  . If a certain nuclide is known to  decay (generally this information must be looked up in a table of isotopes, such as in Appendix B), its  decay equation is



where Y is the nuclide that has two fewer protons than X, such as Th having two fewer than U. So if you were told that  decays and were asked to write the complete decay equation, you would first look up which element has two fewer protons (an atomic number two lower) and find that this is uranium. Then since four nucleons have broken away from the original 239, its atomic mass would be 235.

It is instructive to examine conservation laws related to  that total charge is conserved. Linear and angular momentum are conserved, too.  decay. You can see from the equation Although conserved angular momentum is not of great consequence in this type of decay, conservation of linear momentum has interesting consequences. If the nucleus is at rest when it decays, its momentum is zero. In that case, the fragments must fly in opposite directions with equal-magnitude momenta so that total momentum remains zero. This results in the  particle carrying away most of the energy, as a bullet from a heavy rifle carries away most of the energy of the powder burned to shoot it. Total mass–energy is also conserved: the energy produced in the decay comes from conversion of a fraction of the original mass. As discussed in Atomic Physics, the general relationship is



Here,  is the nuclear reaction energy (the reaction can be nuclear decay or any other reaction), and  is the difference in mass between initial and final products. When the final products have less total mass,  is positive, and the reaction releases energy (is exothermic). When the products have greater total mass, the reaction is endothermic  is negative) and must be induced with an energy input. For  decay to be spontaneous, the decay products must have smaller mass than the parent.

# EXAMPLE 31.2

# Alpha Decay Energy Found from Nuclear Masses

Find the energy emitted in the  decay of  .

# Strategy

Nuclear reaction energy, such as released in  decay, can be found using the equation  . We must first find  , the difference in mass between the parent nucleus and the products of the decay. This is easily done using masses given in Appendix A.

# Solution

The decay equation was given earlier for  ; it is



Thus the pertinent masses are those of  , and the  particle or  , all of which are listed in Appendix A. The initial mass was  . The final mass is the sum   
 Thus,

Now we can find  by entering  into the equation:



We know  , and so



# Discussion

The energy released in this  decay is in the range, about  times as great as typical chemical reaction energies, consistent with many previous discussions. Most of this energy becomes kinetic energy of the  particle (or  nucleus), which moves away at high speed. The energy carried away by the recoil of the  nucleus is much smaller in order to conserve momentum. The  nucleus can be left in an excited state to later emit photons ( rays). This decay is spontaneous and releases energy, because the products have less mass than the parent nucleus. The question of why the products have less mass will be discussed in Binding Energy. Note that the masses given in Appendix A are atomic masses of neutral atoms, including their electrons. The mass of the electrons is the same before and after  decay, and so their masses subtract out when finding  . In this case, there are 94 electrons before and after the decay.

# Beta Decay

There are actually three types of beta decay. The first discovered was “ordinary” beta decay and is called  decay or electron emission. The symbol  represents an electron emitted in nuclear beta decay. Cobalt-60 is a nuclide that  decays in the following manner:



The neutrino is a particle emitted in beta decay that was unanticipated and is of fundamental importance. The neutrino was not even proposed in theory until more than 20 years after beta decay was known to involve electron emissions. Neutrinos are so difficult to detect that the first direct evidence of them was not obtained until 1953. Neutrinos are nearly massless, have no charge, and do not interact with nucleons via the strong nuclear force. Traveling approximately at the speed of light, they have little time to affect any nucleus they encounter. This is, owing to the fact that they have no charge (and they are not EM waves), they do not interact through the EM force. They do interact via the relatively weak and very short range weak nuclear force. Consequently, neutrinos escape almost any detector and penetrate almost any shielding. However, neutrinos do carry energy, angular momentum (they are fermions with half-integral spin), and linear momentum away from a beta decay. When accurate measurements of beta decay were made, it became apparent that energy, angular momentum, and linear momentum were not accounted for by the daughter nucleus and electron alone. Either a previously unsuspected particle was carrying them away, or three conservation laws were being violated. Wolfgang Pauli made a formal proposal for the existence of neutrinos in 1930. The Italian-born American physicist Enrico Fermi (1901–1954) gave neutrinos their name, meaning little neutral ones, when he developed a sophisticated theory of beta decay (see Figure 31.16). Part of Fermi’s theory was the identification of the weak nuclear force as being distinct from the strong nuclear force and in fact responsible for beta decay. Chinese-born physicist Chien-Shiung Wu, who had developed a number of processes critical to the Manhattan Project and related research, set out to investigate Fermi’s theory and some experiments whose failures had cast the theory in doubt. She first identified a number of flaws in her contemporaries’ methods and materials, and then designed an experimental method that would avoid the same errors. Wu verified Fermi’s theory and went on to establish the core principles of beta decay, which would become critical to further work in nuclear physics.  
FIGURE 31.16 (a) Enrico Fermi made significant contributions both as an experimentalist and a theorist. His many contributions to theoretical physics included the identification of the weak nuclear force. The fermi (fm) is named after him, as are an entire class of subatomic particles (fermions), an element (Fermium), and a major research laboratory (Fermilab).

She became the world’s expert on the subject, and contributed to work that led to a Nobel Prize, even though she was denied the award. (credit: Smithsonian Institute)

The neutrino also reveals a new conservation law. There are various families of particles, one of which is the electron family. We propose that the number of members of the electron family is constant in any process or any closed system. In our example of beta decay, there are no members of the electron family present before the decay, but after, there is an electron and a neutrino. So electrons are given an electron family number of  . The neutrino in  decay is an electron’s antineutrino, given the symbol  , where  is the Greek letter nu, and the subscript  means this neutrino is related to the electron. The bar indicates this is a particle of antimatter. (All particles have antimatter counterparts that are nearly identical except that they have the opposite charge. Antimatter is almost entirely absent on Earth, but it is found in nuclear decay and other nuclear and particle reactions as well as in outer space.) The electron’s antineutrino  , being antimatter, has an electron family number of . The total is zero, before and after the decay. The new conservation law, obeyed in all circumstances, states that the total electron nl oiua law is analogous to the conservation of charge in a situation where total charge is originally zero, and equal amounts of positive and negative charge must be created in a reaction to keep the total zero.

If a nuclide  is known to  decay, then its  decay equation is



where Y is the nuclide having one more proton than  (see Figure 31.17). So if you know that a certain nuclide  decays, you can find the daughter nucleus by first looking up  for the parent and then determining which element has atomic number  . In the example of the  decay of  given earlier, we see that  for Co and  is Ni. It is as if one of the neutrons in the parent nucleus decays into a proton, electron, and neutrino. In fact, neutrons outside of nuclei do just that—they live only an average of a few minutes and  decay in the following manner:



  
FIGURE 31.17 In  decay, the parent nucleus emits an electron and an antineutrino. The daughter nucleus has one more proton and one less neutron than its parent. Neutrinos interact so weakly that they are almost never directly observed, but they play a fundamental role in particle physics.

We see that charge is conserved in  decay, since the total charge is  before and after the decay. For example, in  decay, total charge is 27 before decay, since cobalt has  . After decay, the daughter nucleus is Ni, which has  , and there is an electron, so that the total charge is also  or 27. Angular momentum is conserved, but not obviously (you have to examine the spins and angular momenta of the final products in detail to verify this). Linear momentum is also conserved, again imparting most of the decay energy to the electron and the antineutrino, since they are of low and zero mass, respectively. Another new conservation law is obeyed here andelsewhere in nature. The total number of nucleons is conserved. In  decay, for example, there are 60 nucleons before and after the decay. Note that total  is also conserved in  decay. Also note that the total number of protons changes, as does the total number of neutrons, so that total  and total  are not conserved in  decay, as they are in  decay. Energy released in  decay can be calculated given the masses of the parent and products.

# EXAMPLE 31.3

#  Decay Energy from Masses

Find the energy emitted in the  decay of  .

# Strategy and Concept

As in the preceding example, we must first find  , the difference in mass between the parent nucleus and the products of the decay, using masses given in Appendix A. Then the emitted energy is calculated as before, using  . The initial mass is just that of the parent nucleus, and the final mass is that of the daughter nucleus and the electron created in the decay. The neutrino is massless, or nearly so. However, since the masses given in Appendix A are for neutral atoms, the daughter nucleus has one more electron than the parent, and so the extra electron mass that corresponds to the  is included in the atomic mass of Ni. Thus,



# Solution

The  decay equation for  is



As noticed,



Entering the masses found in Appendix A gives



Thus,



Using  , we obtain



# Discussion and Implications

Perhaps the most difficult thing about this example is convincing yourself that the  mass is included in the atomic mass of  . Beyond that are other implications. Again the decay energy is in the MeV range. This energy is shared by all of the products of the decay. In many  decays, the daughter nucleus  is left in an excited state and emits photons ( rays). Most of the remaining energy  to the electron and neutrino, since the recoil kinetic energy of the daughter nucleus is small. One final note: the electron emitted in  decay is created in the nucleus at the time of decay.

The second type of beta decay is less common than the first. It is  decay. Certain nuclides decay by the emission of a positive electron. This is antielectron or positron decay (see Figure 31.18).  
FIGURE 31.18  decay is the emission of a positron that eventually finds an electron to annihilate, characteristically producing gammas in opposite directions.

The antielectron is often represented by the symbol  , but in beta decay it is written as  to indicate the antielectron was emitted in a nuclear decay. Antielectrons are the antimatter counterpart to electrons, being nearly identical, having the same mass, spin, and so on, but having a positive charge and an electron family number of  . When a positron encounters an electron, there is a mutual annihilation in which all the mass of the antielectronelectron pair is converted into pure photon energy. (The reaction,  , conserves electron family number as well as all other conserved quantities.) If a nuclide  is known to  decay, then its  decay equation is



where Y is the nuclide having one less proton than X (to conserve charge) and  is the symbol for the electron’s neutrino, which has an electron family number of  . Since an antimatter member of the electron family (the  ) is created in the decay, a matter member of the family (here the  ) must also be created. Given, for example, that  decays, you can write its full decay equation by first finding that  for  , so that the daughter nuclide will have  , the atomic number for neon. Thus the  decay equation for  is



In  decay, it is as if one of the protons in the parent nucleus decays into a neutron, a positron, and a neutrino. Protons do not do this outside of the nucleus, and so the decay is due to the complexities of the nuclear force. Note again that the total number of nucleons is constant in this and any other reaction. To find the energy emitted in  decay, you must again count the number of electrons in the neutral atoms, since atomic masses are used. The daughter has one less electron than the parent, and one electron mass is created in the decay. Thus, in  decay,



since we use the masses of neutral atoms.

Electron capture is the third type of beta decay. Here, a nucleus captures an inner-shell electron and undergoes a nuclear reaction that has the same effect as  decay. Electron capture is sometimes denoted by the letters EC. We know that electrons cannot reside in the nucleus, but this is a nuclear reaction that consumes the electron and occurs spontaneously only when the products have less mass than the parent plus the electron. If a nuclide  is known to undergo electron capture, then its electron capture equation is



Any nuclide that can  decay can also undergo electron capture (and often does both). The same conservation laws are obeyed for EC as for  decay. It is good practice to confirm these for yourself.

All forms of beta decay occur because the parent nuclide is unstable and lies outside the region of stability in the chart of nuclides. Those nuclides that have relatively more neutrons than those in the region of stability will  decay to produce a daughter with fewer neutrons, producing a daughter nearer the region of stability. Similarly, those nuclides having relatively more protons than those in the region of stability will  decay or undergo electron capture to produce a daughter with fewer protons, nearer the region of stability.

# Gamma Decay

Gamma decay is the simplest form of nuclear decay—it is the emission of energetic photons by nuclei left in an excited state by some earlier process. Protons and neutrons in an excited nucleus are in higher orbitals, and they fall to lower levels by photon emission (analogous to electrons in excited atoms). Nuclear excited states have lifetimestypically of only about  , an indication of the great strength of the forces pulling the nucleons to lower states. The decay equation is simply



where the asterisk indicates the nucleus is in an excited state. There may be one or more s emitted, depending on how the nuclide de-excites. In radioactive decay, emission is common and is preceded by or  decay. For example, when  decays, it most often leaves the daughter nucleus in an excited state, written  . Then the nickel nucleus quickly decays by the emission of two penetrating s:



These are called cobalt rays, although they come from nickel—they are used for cancer therapy, for example. It is again constructive to verify the conservation laws for gamma decay. Finally, since decay does not change the nuclide to another species, it is not prominently featured in charts of decay series, such as that in Figure 31.14.

There are other types of nuclear decay, but they occur less commonly than  , and decay. Spontaneous fission is the most important of the other forms of nuclear decay because of its applications in nuclear power and weapons. It is covered in the next chapter.

# 31.5 Half-Life and Activity

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Define half-life.   
Define dating.   
Calculate age of old objects by radioactive dating.

Unstable nuclei decay. However, some nuclides decay faster than others. For example, radium and polonium, discovered by the Curies, decay faster than uranium. This means they have shorter lifetimes, producing a greater rate of decay. In this section we explore half-life and activity, the quantitative terms for lifetime and rate of decay.

# Half-Life

Why use a term like half-life rather than lifetime? The answer can be found by examining Figure 31.19, which shows how the number of radioactive nuclei in a sample decreases with time. The time in which half of the original number of nuclei decay is defined as the half-life,  .Half of the remaining nuclei decay in the next half-life. Further, half of that amount decays in the following half-life. Therefore, the number of radioactive nuclei decreases from  to  in one half-life, then to  in the next, and to  in the next, and so on. If  is a large number, then many halflives (not just two) pass before all of the nuclei decay. Nuclear decay is an example of a purely statistical process. A more precise definition of half-life is that each nucleus has a  chance of living for a time equal to one half-life  . Thus, if  is reasonably large, half of the original nuclei decay in a time of one half-life. If an individual nucleus makes it through that time, it still has a  chance of surviving through another half-life. Even if it happens to make it through hundreds of half-lives, it still has a  chance of surviving through one more. The probability of decay is the same no matter when you start counting. This is like random coin flipping. The chance of heads is  , no matter what has happened before.  
FIGURE 31.19 Radioactive decay reduces the number of radioactive nuclei over time. In one half-life  , the number decreases to half of its original value. Half of what remains decay in the next half-life, and half of those in the next, and so on. This is an exponential decay, as seen in the graph of the number of nuclei present as a function of time.

There is a tremendous range in the half-lives of various nuclides, from as short as  s for the most unstable, to more than  y for the least unstable, or about 46 orders of magnitude. Nuclides with the shortest half-lives are those for which the nuclear forces are least attractive, an indication of the extent to which the nuclear force can depend on the particular combination of neutrons and protons. The concept of half-life is applicable to other subatomic particles, as will be discussed in Particle Physics. It is also applicable to the decay of excited states in atoms and nuclei. The following equation gives the quantitative relationship between the original number of nuclei present at time zero  and the number  at a later time  :



where  is the base of the natural logarithm, and  is the decay constant for the nuclide. The shorter the half-life, the larger is the value of  , and the faster the exponential  decreases with time. The relationship between the decay constant  and the half-life  is



To see how the number of nuclei declines to half its original value in one half-life, let  in the exponential in the equation  . This gives  . For integral numbers of half-lives, you can just divide the original number by 2 over and over again, rather than using the exponential relationship. For example, if ten half-lives have passed, we divide  by 2 ten times. This reduces it to . For an arbitrary time, not just a multiple of the half-life, the exponential relationship must be used.

Radioactive dating is a clever use of naturally occurring radioactivity. Its most famous application is carbon-14 dating. Carbon-14 has a half-life of 5730 years and is produced in a nuclear reaction induced when solar neutrinos strike  in the atmosphere. Radioactive carbon has the same chemistry as stable carbon, and so it mixes into the ecosphere, where it is consumed and becomes part of every living organism. Carbon-14 has an abundance of 1.3 parts per trillion of normal carbon. Thus, if you know the number of carbon nuclei in an object (perhaps determined by mass and Avogadro’s number), you multiply that number by  to find the number of  nuclei in the object. When an organism dies, carbon exchange with the environment ceases, and  is not replenished as it decays. By comparing the abundance of  in an artifact, such as mummy wrappings, with the normal abundance in living tissue, it is possible to determine the artifact’s age (or time since death). Carbon-14 dating can be used for biological tissues as old as 50 or 60 thousand years, but is most accurate for younger samples, since the abundance of  nuclei in them is greater. Very old biological materials contain no  at all. There are instances in which the date of an artifact can be determined by other means, such as historical knowledge or tree-ring counting. These cross-references have confirmed the validity of carbon-14 dating and permitted us to calibrate the technique as well. Carbon-14 dating revolutionized parts of archaeology and is of such importance that it earned the 1960 Nobel Prize in chemistry for its developer, the American chemist Willard Libby (1908–1980).One of the most famous cases of carbon-14 dating involves the Shroud of Turin, a long piece of fabric purported to be the burial shroud of Jesus (see Figure 31.20). This relic was first displayed in Turin in 1354 and was denounced as a fraud at that time by a French bishop. Its remarkable negative imprint of an apparently crucified body resembles the then-accepted image of Jesus, and so the shroud was never disregarded completely and remained controversial over the centuries. Carbon-14 dating was not performed on the shroud until 1988, when the process had been refined to the point where only a small amount of material needed to be destroyed. Samples were tested at three independent laboratories, each being given four pieces of cloth, with only one unidentified piece from the shroud, to avoid prejudice. All three laboratories found samples of the shroud contain  of the  found in living tissues, allowing the shroud to be dated (see Example 31.4).

  
FIGURE 31.20 Part of the Shroud of Turin, which shows a remarkable negative imprint likeness of Jesus complete with evidence of crucifixion wounds. The shroud first surfaced in the 14th century and was only recently carbon-14 dated. It has not been determined how the image was placed on the material. (credit: Butko, Wikimedia Commons)

# EXAMPLE 31.4

# How Old Is the Shroud of Turin?

Calculate the age of the Shroud of Turin given that the amount of  found in it is  of that in living tissue.

# Strategy

Knowing that  of the  remains means that  . Therefore, the equation  can be used to find . We also know that the half-life of  is  and so once is known, we can use the equation  to find  and then find  as requested. Here, we postulate that the decrease in  is solely due to nuclear decay.

# Solution

Solving the equation  for  gives



Thus,



Taking the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation yields



so that



Rearranging to isolate  gives

Now, the equation  can be used to find  for  . Solving for  and substituting the known half-life gives



We enter this value into the previous equation to find  :



# Discussion

This dates the material in the shroud to  . 1300. Our calculation is only accurate to two digits, so that the year is rounded to 1300. The values obtained at the three independent laboratories gave a weighted average date of a.d.  . The uncertainty is typical of carbon-14 dating and is due to the small amount of  in living tissues, the amount of material available, and experimental uncertainties (reduced by having three independent measurements). It is meaningful that the date of the shroud is consistent with the first record of its existence and inconsistent with the period in which Jesus lived.

There are other forms of radioactive dating. Rocks, for example, can sometimes be dated based on the decay of  . The decay series for  ends with  , so that the ratio of these nuclides in a rock is an indication of how long it has been since the rock solidified. The original composition of the rock, such as the absence of lead, must be known with some confidence. However, as with carbon-14 dating, the technique can be verified by a consistent body of knowledge. Since  has a half-life of  it is useful for dating only very old materials, showing, for example, that the oldest rocks on Earth solidified about  years ago.

# Activity, the Rate of Decay

What do we mean when we say a source is highly radioactive? Generally, this means the number of decays per unit time is very high. We define activity  to be the rate of decay expressed in decays per unit time. In equation form, this is



where  is the number of decays that occur in time  . The SI unit for activity is one decay per second and is given the name becquerel (Bq) in honor of the discoverer of radioactivity. That is,



Activity  is often expressed in other units, such as decays per minute or decays per year. One of the most common units for activity is the curie (Ci), defined to be the activity of  of  , in honor of Marie Curie’s work with radium. The definition of curie is



or  decays per second. A curie is a large unit of activity, while a becquerel is a relatively small unit.  microcuries  . In countries like Australia and New Zealand that adhere more to SI units, most radioactive sources, such as those used in medical diagnostics or in physics laboratories, are labeled in Bq or megabecquerel (MBq).

Intuitively, you would expect the activity of a source to depend on two things: the amount of the radioactive substance present, and its half-life. The greater the number of radioactive nuclei present in the sample, the more will decay per unit of time. The shorter the half-life, the more decays per unit time, for a given number of nuclei. So activity  should be proportional to the number of radioactive nuclei,  , and inversely proportional to their half-life,  . In fact, your intuition is correct. It can be shown that the activity of a source is

where  is the number of radioactive nuclei present, having half-life  . This relationship is useful in a variety of calculations, as the next two examples illustrate.

# EXAMPLE 31.5

# How Great Is the  Activity in Living Tissue?

Calculate the activity due to  in  of carbon found in a living organism. Express the activity in units of Bq and Ci.

# Strategy

To find the activity  using the equation  , we must know  and  . The half-life of  can be found in Appendix B, and was stated above as 5730 y. To find  , we first find the number of  nuclei in  of carbon using the concept of a mole. As indicated, we then multiply by  (the abundance of  in a carbon sample from a living organism) to get the number of  nuclei in a living organism.

# Solution

One mole of carbon has a mass of  since it is nearly pure  . (A mole has a mass in grams equal in magnitude to  found in the periodic table.) Thus the number of carbon nuclei in a kilogram is



So the number of  nuclei in  of carbon is



Now the activity  is found using the equation  .

Entering known values gives



or  decays per year. To convert this to the unit Bq, we simply convert years to seconds. Thus,



or 250 decays per second. To express  in curies, we use the definition of a curie,



Thus,



# Discussion

Our own bodies contain kilograms of carbon, and it is intriguing to think there are hundreds of  decays per second taking place in us. Carbon-14 and other naturally occurring radioactive substances in our bodies contribute to the background radiation we receive. The small number of decays per second found for a kilogram of carbon in this example gives you some idea of how difficult it is to detect  in a small sample of material. If there are 250 decays per second in a kilogram, then there are 0.25 decays per second in a gram of carbon in living tissue. To observe this, you must be able to distinguish decays from other forms of radiation, in order to reduce background noise. This becomes more difficult with an old tissue sample, since it contains less  , and for samples more than50 thousand years old, it is impossible.

Human-made (or artificial) radioactivity has been produced for decades and has many uses. Some of these include medical therapy for cancer, medical imaging and diagnostics, and food preservation by irradiation. Many applications as well as the biological effects of radiation are explored in Medical Applications of Nuclear Physics, but it is clear that radiation is hazardous. A number of tragic examples of this exist, one of the most disastrous being the meltdown and fire at the Chernobyl reactor complex in the Ukraine (see Figure  . Several radioactive isotopes were released in huge quantities, contaminating many thousands of square kilometers and directly affecting hundreds of thousands of people. The most significant releases were of ,  ,   ,  , and  . Estimates are that the total amount of radiation released was about 100 million curies.

# EXAMPLE 31.6

# What Mass of  Escaped Chernobyl?

It is estimated that the Chernobyl disaster released 6.0 MCi of  into the environment. Calculate the mass of released.

# Strategy

We can calculate the mass released using Avogadro’s number and the concept of a mole if we can first find the number of nuclei  released. Since the activity  is given, and the half-life of  is found in Appendix B to be  , we can use the equation  to find  .

# Solution

Solving the equation for  gives



Entering the given values yields



Converting curies to becquerels and years to seconds, we get

One mole of a nuclide  has a mass of  grams, so that one mole of  has a mass of 137 g. A mole has  nuclei. Thus the mass of  released was



# Discussion

While  of material may not be a very large mass compared to the amount of fuel in a power plant, it is extremely radioactive, since it only has a 30-year half-life. Six megacuries  is an extraordinary amount of activity but is only a fraction of what is produced in nuclear reactors. Similar amounts of the other isotopes were also released at Chernobyl. Although the chances of such a disaster may have seemed small, the consequences were extremely severe, requiring greater caution than was used. More will be said about safe reactor design in the next chapter, but it should be noted that more recent reactors have a fundamentally safer design.

Activity  decreases in time, going to half its original value in one half-life, then to one-fourth its original value in the next half-life, and so on. Since  , the activity decreases as the number of radioactive nuclei decreases. The equation for as a function of time is found by combining the equations and , yielding



where  is the activity at  . This equation shows exponential decay of radioactive nuclei. For example, if a source originally has a  activity, it declines to  in one half-life, to  in two half-lives, to  in three half-lives, and so on. For times other than whole half-lives, the equation  must be used to find  .

# 31.6 Binding Energy

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Define and discuss binding energy.   
Calculate the binding energy per nucleon of a particle.

The more tightly bound a system is, the stronger the forces that hold it together and the greater the energy required to pull it apart. We can therefore learn about nuclear forces by examining how tightly bound the nuclei are. We define the binding energy (BE) of a nucleus to be the energy required to completely disassemble it into separate prons anneutrons.We an determin he ucleus om estmas.Thetwo cnecte Einstein’s famous relationship  . A bound system has a smaller mass than its separate constituents; the more tightly the nucleons are bound together, the smaller the mass of the nucleus.

Imagine pulling a nuclide apart as illustrated in Figure 31.22. Work done to overcome the nuclear forces holding the nucleus together puts energy into the system. By definition, the energy input equals the binding energy BE. The pieces are at rest when separated, and so the energy put into them increases their total rest mass compared with what it was when they were glued together as a nucleus. That mass increase is thus  . This difference inmass is known as mass defect. It implies that the mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the masses of its constituent protons and neutrons. A nuclide  has  protons and  neutrons, so that the difference in mass is



Thus,



where  is the mass of the nuclide  is the mass of a proton, and  is the mass of a neutron. Traditionally, we deal with the masses of neutral atoms. To get atomic masses into the last equation, we first add  electrons to  , which gives  , the atomic mass of the nuclide. We then add  electrons to the  protons, which gives  , or  times the mass of a hydrogen atom. Thus the binding energy of a nuclide  is



The atomic masses can be found in Appendix A, most conveniently expressed in unified atomic mass units u  ). BE is thus calculated from known atomic masses.

  
FIGURE 31.22 Work done to pull a nucleus apart into its constituent protons and neutrons increases the mass of the system. The work to disassemble the nucleus equals its binding energy BE. A bound system has less mass than the sum of its parts, especially noticeable in the nuclei, where forces and energies are very large.

# Things Great and Small

# Nuclear Decay Helps Explain Earth’s Hot Interior

A puzzle created by radioactive dating of rocks is resolved by radioactive heating of Earth’s interior. This intriguing story is another example of how small-scale physics can explain large-scale phenomena.

Radioactive dating plays a role in determining the approximate age of the Earth. The oldest rocks on Earth solidified about  years ago—a number determined by uranium-238 dating. These rocks could only have solidified once the surface of the Earth had cooled sufficiently. The temperature of the Earth at formation can be estimated based on gravitational potential energy of the assemblage of pieces being converted to thermal energy. Using heat transfer concepts discussed in Thermodynamics it is then possible to calculate how long it would take for the surface to cool to rock-formation temperatures. The result is about  years. The first rocks formed have been solid for  years, so that the age of the Earth is approximately  years. There is a large body of other types of evidence (both Earth-bound and solar system characteristics are used) that supports this age. The puzzle is that, given its age and initial temperature, the center of the Earth should be much cooler than it is today (see Figure 31.23).  
FIGURE 31.23 The center of the Earth cools by well-known heat transfer methods. Convection in the liquid regions and conduction move thermal energy to the surface, where it radiates into cold, dark space. Given the age of the Earth and its initial temperature, it should have cooled to a lower temperature by now. The blowup shows that nuclear decay releases energy in the Earth’s interior. This energy has slowed the cooling process and is responsible for the interior still being molten.

Danish geophysicist Inge Lehmann was the first to properly interpret seismological data from earthquakes as evidence that the Earth had a solid inner core surrounded by a liquid outer core. Shear or transverse waves cannot travel through a liquid and are not transmitted through the Earth’s core. Yet compression or longitudinal waves can pass through a liquid and do go through the core. From this information, the temperature of the interior can be estimated. As noticed, the interior should have cooled more from its initial temperature in the  years since its formation. In fact, it should have taken no more than about  years to cool to its present temperature. What is keeping it hot? The answer seems to be radioactive decay of primordial elements that were part of the material that formed the Earth (see the blowup in Figure 31.23).

Nuclides such as  and  have half-lives similar to or longer than the age of the Earth, and their decay still contributes energy to the interior. Some of the primordial radioactive nuclides have unstable decay products that also release energy—  has a long decay chain of these. Further, there were more of these primordial radioactive nuclides early in the life of the Earth, and thus the activity and energy contributed were greater then (perhaps by an order of magnitude). The amount of power created by these decays per cubic meter is very small. However, since a huge volume of material lies deep below the surface, this relatively small amount of energy cannot escape quickly. The power produced near the surface has much less distance to go to escape and has a negligible effect on surface temperatures.

A final effect of this trapped radiation merits mention. Alpha decay produces helium nuclei, which form helium atoms when they are stopped and capture electrons. Most of the helium on Earth is obtained from wells and is produced in this manner. Any helium in the atmosphere will escape in geologically short times because of its high thermal velocity.

What patterns and insights are gained from an examination of the binding energy of various nuclides? First, we find that BE is approximately proportional to the number of nucleons  in any nucleus. About twice as much energy is needed to pull apart a nucleus like  compared with pulling apart  , for example. To help us look at other effects, we divide BE by  and consider the binding energy per nucleon, . The graph of in Figure 31.24 reveals some very interesting aspects of nuclei. We see that the binding energy per nucleon averages about  but is lower for both the lightest and heaviest nuclei. This overall trend, in which nuclei with  equal to about 60 have the greatest and are thus the most tightly bound, is due to the combined characteristics of the attractive nuclear forces and the repulsive Coulomb force. It is especially important to note two things—the strong nuclear force is about 100 times stronger than the Coulomb force, and the nuclear forces are shorter in range compared to the Coulomb force. So, for low-mass nuclei, the nuclear attraction dominates and each added nucleon forms bonds with all others, causing progressively heavier nuclei to have progressively greater values of . This continues up to  , roughly corresponding to the mass number of iron. Beyond that, new nucleons added to a nucleus will be too far from some others to feel their nuclear attraction. Added protons, however, feel the repulsion of all other protons, since the Coulomb force is longer in range. Coulomb repulsion grows for progressively heavier nuclei, butnuclear attraction remains about the same, and so becomes smaller. This is why stable nuclei heavier than  have more neutrons than protons. Coulomb repulsion is reduced by having more neutrons to keep the protons farther apart (see Figure 31.25).

  
FIGURE 31.24 A graph of average binding energy per nucleon, , for stable nuclei. The most tightly bound nuclei are those with  near 60, where the attractive nuclear force has its greatest effect. At higher s, the Coulomb repulsion progressively reduces the binding energy per nucleon, because the nuclear force is short ranged. The spikes on the curve are very tightly bound nuclides and indicate shell closures.

  
FIGURE 31.25 The nuclear force is attractive and stronger than the Coulomb force, but it is short ranged. In low-mass nuclei, each nucleon feels the nuclear attraction of all others. In larger nuclei, the range of the nuclear force, shown for a single nucleon, is smaller than the size of the nucleus, but the Coulomb repulsion from all protons reaches all others. If the nucleus is large enough, the Coulomb repulsion can add to overcome the nuclear attraction.

There are some noticeable spikes on the graph, which represent particularly tightly bound nuclei. These spikes reveal further details of nuclear forces, such as confirming that closed-shell nuclei (those with magic numbers of protons or neutrons or both) are more tightly bound. The spikes also indicate that some nuclei with even numbers for  and  , and with  , are exceptionally tightly bound. This finding can be correlated with some of the cosmic abundances of the elements. The most common elements in the universe, as determined by observations of atomic spectra from outer space, are hydrogen, followed by  , with much smaller amounts of  and other elements. It should be noted that the heavier elements are created in supernova explosions, while the lighter ones are produced by nuclear fusion during the normal life cycles of stars, as will be discussed in subsequent chapters. The most common elements have the most tightly bound nuclei. It is also no accident that one of the most tightly bound light nuclei is  , emitted in  decay.# EXAMPLE 31.7

# What Is for an Alpha Particle?

Calculate the binding energy per nucleon of  , the  particle.

# Strategy

To find  , we first find BE using the Equation  and then divide by . This is straightforward once we have looked up the appropriate atomic masses in Appendix A.

# Solution

The binding energy for a nucleus is given by the equation



For  , we have  ; thus,



Appendix A gives these masses as  and  . Thus,



Noting that  , we find



Since  , we see that  is this number divided by 4, or



# Discussion

This is a large binding energy per nucleon compared with those for other low-mass nuclei, which have  . This indicates that  is tightly bound compared with its neighbors on the chart of the nuclides. You can see the spike representing this value of for  on the graph in Figure 31.24. This is why  is stable. Since  is tightly bound, it has less mass than other  nuclei and, therefore, cannot spontaneously decay into them. The large binding energy also helps to explain why some nuclei undergo  decay. Smaller mass in the decay products can mean energy release, and such decays can be spontaneous. Further, it can happen that two protons and two neutrons in a nucleus can randomly find themselves together, experience the exceptionally large nuclear force that binds this combination, and act as a  unit within the nucleus, at least for a while. In some cases, the  escapes, and  decay has then taken place.

There is more to be learned from nuclear binding energies. The general trend in  is fundamental to energy production in stars, and to fusion and fission energy sources on Earth, for example. This is one of the applications of nuclear physics covered in Medical Applications of Nuclear Physics. The abundance of elements on Earth, in stars, and in the universe as a whole is related to the binding energy of nuclei and has implications for the continued expansion of the universe.

# Problem-Solving Strategies

# For Reaction And Binding Energies and Activity Calculations in Nuclear Physics

1. Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns). This will allow you to decide whether the energy of a decay or nuclear reaction is involved, for example, or whether the problem is primarily concerned with activity (rate of decay).   
2. Make a list of what is given or can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns).   
3. For reaction and binding-energy problems, we use atomic rather than nuclear masses. Since the masses of neutral atoms are used, you must count the number of electrons involved. If these do not balance (such as in  decay), then an energy adjustment of 0.511 MeV per electron must be made. Also note that atomic massesmay not be given in a problem; they can be found in tables.

4. For problems involving activity, the relationship of activity to half-life, and the number of nuclei given in the equation  can eveyse whecatb c olv  will ale to be familiar with moles and Avogadro’s number.

5. Perform the desired calculation; keep careful track of plus and minus signs as well as powers of 10.

6. Check the answer to see if it is reasonable: Does it make sense? Compare your results with worked examples and other information in the text. (Heeding the advice in Step 5 will also help you to be certain of your result.) You must understand the problem conceptually to be able to determine whether the numerical result is reasonable.

# 31.7 Tunneling

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Define and discuss tunneling.   
Define potential barrier.   
Explain quantum tunneling.

Protons and neutrons are bound inside nuclei, that means energy must be supplied to break them away. The situation is analogous to a marble in a bowl that can roll around but lacks the energy to get over the rim. It is bound inside the bowl (see Figure 31.26). If the marble could get over the rim, it would gain kinetic energy by rolling down outside. However classically, if the marble does not have enough kinetic energy to get over the rim, it remains forever trapped in its well.

  
FIGURE 31.26 The marble in this semicircular bowl at the top of a volcano has enough kinetic energy to get to the altitude of the dashed line, but not enough to get over the rim, so that it is trapped forever. If it could find a tunnel through the barrier, it would escape, roll downhill, and gain kinetic energy.

In a nucleus, the attractive nuclear potential is analogous to the bowl at the top of a volcano (where the “volcano” refers only to the shape). Protons and neutrons have kinetic energy, but it is about  less than that needed to get out (see Figure 31.27). That is, they are bound by an average of 8 MeV per nucleon. The slope of the hill outside the bowl is analogous to the repulsive Coulomb potential for a nucleus, such as for an  particle outside a positive nucleus. In  decay, two protons and two neutrons spontaneously break away as a  unit. Yet the protons and neutrons do not have enough kinetic energy to get over the rim. So how does the  particle get out?  
FIGURE 31.27 Nucleons within an atomic nucleus are bound or trapped by the attractive nuclear force, as shown in this simplified potential energy curve. An  particle outside the range of the nuclear force feels the repulsive Coulomb force. The  particle inside the nucleus does not have enough kinetic energy to get over the rim, yet it does manage to get out by quantum mechanical tunneling.

The answer was supplied in 1928 by the Russian physicist George Gamow (1904–1968). The  particle tunnels through a region of space it is forbidden to be in, and it comes out of the side of the nucleus. Like an electron making a transition between orbits around an atom, it travels from one point to another without ever having been in between. Figure 31.28 indicates how this works. The wave function of a quantum mechanical particle varies smoothly, going from within an atomic nucleus (on one side of a potential energy barrier) to outside the nucleus (on the other side of the potential energy barrier). Inside the barrier, the wave function does not become zero but decreases exponentially, and we do not observe the particle inside the barrier. The probability of finding a particle is related to the square of its wave function, and so there is a small probability of finding the particle outside the barrier, which implies that the particle can tunnel through the barrier. This process is called barrier penetration or quantum mechanical tunneling. This concept was developed in theory by J. Robert Oppenheimer (who led the development of the first nuclear bombs during World War II) and was used by Gamow and others to describe  decay.

  
FIGURE 31.28 The wave function representing a quantum mechanical particle must vary smoothly, going from within the nucleus (to the left of the barrier) to outside the nucleus (to the right of the barrier). Inside the barrier, the wave function does not abruptly become zero; rather, it decreases exponentially. Outside the barrier, the wave function is small but finite, and there it smoothly becomes sinusoidal. Owing to the fact that there is a small probability of finding the particle outside the barrier, the particle can tunnel through the barrier.

Good ideas explain more than one thing. In addition to qualitatively explaining how the four nucleons in an  particle can get out of the nucleus, the detailed theory also explains quantitatively the half-life of various nuclei that undergo  decay. This description is what Gamow and others devised, and it works for  decay half-lives that vary by 17 orders of magnitude. Experiments have shown that the more energetic the  decay of a particular nuclide is, the shorter is its half-life. Tunneling explains this in the following manner: For the decay to be more energetic, the nucleons must have more energy in the nucleus and should be able to ascend a little closer to the rim. The barrier is therefore not as thick for more energetic decay, and the exponential decrease of the wave function inside the barrier is not as great. Thus the probability of finding the particle outside the barrier is greater, and the half-life is shorter.

Tunneling as an effect also occurs in quantum mechanical systems other than nuclei. Electrons trapped in solids can tunnel from one object to another if the barrier between the objects is thin enough. The process is the same in principle as described for  decay. It is far more likely for a thin barrier than a thick one. Scanning tunneling electron microscopes function on this principle. The current of electrons that travels between a probe and a sample tunnels through a barrier and is very sensitive to its thickness, allowing detection of individual atoms as shown in Figure  
FIGURE 31.29 (a) A scanning tunneling electron microscope can detect extremely small variations in dimensions, such as individual atoms. Electrons tunnel quantum mechanically between the probe and the sample. The probability of tunneling is extremely sensitive to barrier thickness, so that the electron current is a sensitive indicator of surface features.

# Section Summary

# 31.1 Nuclear Radioactivity

• Some nuclei are radioactive—they spontaneously decay destroying some part of their mass and emitting energetic rays, a process called nuclear radioactivity. Nuclear radiation, like x rays, is ionizing radiation, because energy sufficient to ionize matter is emitted in each decay. The range (or distance traveled in a material) of ionizing radiation is directly related to the charge of the emitted particle and its energy, with greatercharge and lower-energy particles having the shortest ranges. Radiation detectors are based directly or indirectly upon the ionization created by radiation, as are the effects of radiation on living and inert materials.

# 31.2 Radiation Detection and Detectors

• Radiation detectors are based directly or indirectly upon the ionization created by radiation, as are the effects of radiation on living and inert materials.

# 31.3 Substructure of the Nucleus

• Two particles, both called nucleons, are found inside nuclei. The two types of nucleons are protons and neutrons; they are very similar, except that the proton is positively charged while the neutron is neutral. Some of their characteristics are given in Table 31.2 and compared with those of the electron. A mass unit convenient to atomic and nuclear processes is the unified atomic mass unit (u), defined to be    
A nuclide is a specific combination of protons and neutrons, denoted by  or simply  ,  is the number of protons or atomic number, X is the symbol for the element,  is the number of neutrons, and  is the mass number or the total number of protons and neutrons,    
• Nuclides having the same  but different  are isotopes of the same element.   
The radius of a nucleus,  , is approximately r = r0A1/3, where  . Nuclear volumes are proportional to  . There are two nuclear forces, the weak and the strong. Systematics in nuclear stability seen on the chart of the nuclides indicate that there are shell closures in nuclei for values of  and  equal to the magic numbers, which correspond to highly stable nuclei.

# 31.4 Nuclear Decay and Conservation Laws

• When a parent nucleus decays, it produces a daughter nucleus following rules and conservation laws. There are three major types of nuclear decay, called alpha  beta  and gamma . The  decay equation is  Nuclear decay releases an amount of energy  related to the mass destroyed by  There are three forms of beta decay.

In addition to all previously known conservation laws, two new ones arise— conservation of electron family number and conservation of the total number of nucleons. The decay equation is  is a high-energy photon originating in a nucleus.# 31.5 Half-Life and Activity

• Half-life  is the time in which there is a  chance that a nucleus will decay. The number of nuclei  as a function of time is N = Ne−λt, where  is the number present at  , and  is the decay constant, related to the half-life by  One of the applications of radioactive decay is radioactive dating, in which the age of a material is determined by the amount of radioactive decay that occurs.
