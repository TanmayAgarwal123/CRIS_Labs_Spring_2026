INTRODUCTION TO WORK, ENERGY, AND ENERGY RESOURCES events and in scientific phenomena. You can no doubt name many forms of energy, from that provided by our foods, to the energy we use to run our cars, to the sunlight that warms us on the beach. You can also cite examples of what people call energy that may not be scientific, such as someone having an energetic personality. Not only does energy have many interesting forms, it is involved in almost all phenomena, and is one of the most important concepts of physics. What makes it even more important is that the total amount of energy in the universe is constant. Energy can change forms, but it cannot appear from nothing or disappear without a trace. Energy is thus one of a handful of physical quantities that we say is conserved.

Conservation of energy (as physicists like to call the principle that energy can neither be created nor destroyed) is based on experiment. For example, scientists Willem ’s Gravesande and Émilie du Châtelet undertook (separate) experiments where they dropped heavy lead balls into beds of clay. Du Châtelet showed that the balls that hit the clay with twice the velocity penetrated four times as deep into the clay; those with three times the velocity reached a depth nine times greater. This led her to develop a more accurate concept of energy conservation, expressed as  . Even as scientists discovered new forms of energy, conservation of energy has always been found to apply. Perhaps the most dramatic example of this was supplied by Einstein when he suggested that mass is equivalent to energy (his famous equation  ).

From a societal viewpoint, energy is one of the major building blocks of modern civilization. Energy resources arekey limiting factors to economic growth. The world use of energy resources, especially oil, continues to grow, with ominous consequences economically, socially, politically, and environmentally. We will briefly examine the world’s energy use patterns at the end of this chapter.

There is no simple, yet accurate, scientific definition for energy. Energy is characterized by its many forms and the fact that it is conserved. We can loosely define energy as the ability to do work, admitting that in some circumstances not all energy is available to do work. Because of the association of energy with work, we begin the chapter with a discussion of work. Work is intimately related to energy and how energy moves from one system to another or changes form.

# 7.1 Work: The Scientific Definition

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Explain how an object must be displaced for a force on it to do work. Explain how relative directions of force and displacement determine whether the work done is positive, negative, or zero.

# What It Means to Do Work

The scientific definition of work differs in some ways from its everyday meaning. Certain things we think of as hard work, such as writing an exam or carrying a heavy load on level ground, are not work as defined by a scientist. The scientific definition of work reveals its relationship to energy—whenever work is done, energy is transferred.

For work, in the scientific sense, to be done, a force must be exerted and there must be displacement in the direction of the force.

Formally, the work done on a system by a constant force is defined to be the product of the component of the force iohtohich.ayot this is expressed in equation form as



where is work, is the displacement of the system, and  is the angle between the force vector and the displacement vector , as in Figure 7.2. We can also write this as



To find the work done on a system that undergoes motion that is not one-way or that is in two or three dimensions, we divide the motion into one-way one-dimensional segments and add up the work done over each segment.

# What is Work?

The work done on a system by a constant force is the product of the component of the force in the direction of mono io in equation form as



where  is work,  is the magnitude of the force on the system,  is the magnitude of the displacement of the system, and  is the angle between the force vector  and the displacement vector .  
FIGURE 7.2 Examples of work. (a) The work done by the force on this lawn mower is  cos  . Note that  cos  is the component of the force in the direction of motion. (b) A person holding a briefcase does no work on it, because there is no displacement. No energy is transferred to or from the briefcase. (c) The person moving the briefcase horizontally at a constant speed does no work on it, and transfers no energy to it. (d) Work is done on the briefcase by carrying it up stairs at constant speed, because there is necessarily a component of force in the direction of the motion. Energy is transferred to the briefcase and could in turn be used to do work. (e) When the briefcase is lowered, energy is transferred out of the briefcase and into an electric generator. Here the work done on the briefcase by the generator is negative, removing energy from the briefcase, because and are in opposite directions.

To examine what the definition of work means, let us consider the other situations shown in Figure 7.2. The person holding the briefcase in Figure 7.2(b) does no work, for example. Here  , so  . Why is it you get tired just holding a load? The answer is that your muscles are doing work against one another, but they are doing no work on thstemterest h ricasar stemeGavial otenl nergmordetail.h must be displacement for work to be done, and there must be a component of the force in the direction of themotion. For example, the person carrying the briefcase on level ground in Figure 7.2(c) does no work on it, because the force is perpendicular to the motion. That is,  , and so  .

In contrast, when a force exerted on the system has a component in the direction of motion, such as in Figure 7.2(d), work is done—energy is transferred to the briefcase. Finally, in Figure 7.2(e), energy is transferred from the briefcase to a generator. There are two good ways to interpret this energy transfer. One interpretation is that the briefcase’s weight does work on the generator, giving it energy. The other interpretation is that the generator does negative work on the briefcase, thus removing energy from it. The drawing shows the latter, with the force from the generator upward on the briefcase, and the displacement downward. This makes  , and  ; therefore, is negative.

# Calculating Work

Work and energy have the same units. From the definition of work, we see that those units are force times distance. Thus, in SI units, work and energy are measured in newton-meters. A newton-meter is given the special name joule (J), and  . One joule is not a large amount of energy; it would lift a small 100-gram apple a distance of about 1 meter.

# EXAMPLE 7.1

# Calculating the Work You Do to Push a Lawn Mower Across a Large Lawn

How much work is done on the lawn mower by the person in Figure 7.2(a) if he exerts a constant force of  at an angle  below the horizontal and pushes the mower  on level ground? Convert the amount of work from joules to kilocalories and compare it with this person’s average daily intake of  (about  ) of food energy. One calorie (1 cal) of heat is the amount required to warm  of water by  , and is equivalent to , while one food calorie  is equivalent to .

# Strategy

We can solve this problem by substituting the given values into the definition of work done on a system, stated in the equation  cos  . The force, angle, and displacement are given, so that only the work  is unknown.

# Solution

The equation for the work is



Substituting the known values gives



Converting the work in joules to kilocalories yields  . The ratio of the work done to the daily consumption is



# Discussion

This ratio is a tiny fraction of what the person consumes, but it is typical. Very little of the energy released in the consumption of food is used to do work. Even when we “work” all day long, less than  of our food energy intake is used to do work and more than  is converted to thermal energy or stored as chemical energy in fat.# 7.2 Kinetic Energy and the Work-Energy Theorem

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Explain work as a transfer of energy and net work as the work done by the net force.   
Explain and apply the work-energy theorem.

# Work Transfers Energy

What happens to the work done on a system? Energy is transferred into the system, but in what form? Does it remain in the system or move on? The answers depend on the situation. For example, if the lawn mower in Figure 7.2(a) is pushed just hard enough to keep it going at a constant speed, then energy put into the mower by the person is removed continuously by friction, and eventually leaves the system in the form of heat transfer. In contrast, work done on the briefcase by the person carrying it up stairs in Figure 7.2(d) is stored in the briefcase-Earth system and can be recovered at any time, as shown in Figure 7.2(e). In fact, the building of the pyramids in ancient Egypt is an example of storing energy in a system by doing work on the system. Some of the energy imparted to the stone blocks in lifting them during construction of the pyramids remains in the stone-Earth system and has the potential to do work.

In this section we begin the study of various types of work and forms of energy. We will find that some types of work leave the energy of a system constant, for example, whereas others change the system in some way, such as making it move. We will also develop definitions of important forms of energy, such as the energy of motion.

# Net Work and the Work-Energy Theorem

We know from the study of Newton’s laws in Dynamics: Force and Newton's Laws of Motion that net force causes acceleration. We will see in this section that work done by the net force gives a system energy of motion, and in the process we will also find an expression for the energy of motion.

Let us start by considering the total, or net, work done on a system. Net work is defined to be the sum of work on an object. The net work can be written in terms of the net force on an object.  . In equation form, this is  cos  where  is the angle between the force vector and the displacement vector.

Figure 7.3(a) shows a graph of force versus displacement for the component of the force in the direction of the displacement—that is, an  cos  vs.  graph. In this case,  cos  is constant. You can see that the area under the graph is  cos  , or the work done. Figure 7.3(b) shows a more general process where the force varies. The area under the curve is divided into strips, each having an average force  . The work done is  for each strip, and the total work done is the sum of the  . Thus the total work done is the total area under the curve, a useful property to which we shall refer later.  
FIGURE 7.3 (a) A graph of  cos  vs.  , when  cos  is constant. The area under the curve represents the work done by the force. (b) A graph of  cos  vs.  in which the force varies. The work done for each interval is the area of each strip; thus, the total area under the curve equals the total work done.

Net work will be simpler to examine if we consider a one-dimensional situation where a force is used to accelerate an object in a direction parallel to its initial velocity. Such a situation occurs for the package on the roller belt conveyor system shown in Figure 7.4.

  
FIGURE 7.4 A package on a roller belt is pushed horizontally through a distance .

The force of gravity and the normal force acting on the package are perpendicular to the displacement and do no work. Moreover, they are also equal in magnitude and opposite in direction so they cancel in calculating the net force. The net force arises solely from the horizontal applied force  and the horizontal friction force . Thus, as expected, the net force is parallel to the displacement, so that  and  , and the net work is given by



The effect of the net force  is to accelerate the package from  to  . The kinetic energy of the package increases, indicating that the net work done on the system is positive. (See Example 7.2.) By using Newton’s second law, and doing some algebra, we can reach an interesting conclusion. Substituting  from Newton’s second law gives



To get a relationship between net work and the speed given to a system by the net force acting on it, we take  and use the equation studied in Motion Equations for Constant Acceleration in One Dimension for the change in speed over a distance  if the acceleration has the constant value  ; namely,  (note that  appears in the expression for the net work). Solving for acceleration gives  . When  is substituted intothe preceding expression for  , we obtain



The  cancels, and we rearrange this to obtain



This expression is called the work-energy theorem, and it actually applies in general (even for forces that vary in direction and magnitude), although we have derived it for the special case of a constant force parallel to the displacement. The theorem implies that the net work on a system equals the change in the quantity  . This quantity is our first example of a form of energy.

# The Work-Energy Theorem

The net work on a system equals the change in the quantity  .



The quantity  in the work-energy theorem is defined to be the translational kinetic energy (KE) of a mass moving at a speed  . (Translational kinetic energy is distinct from rotational kinetic energy, which is considered later.) In equation form, the translational kinetic energy,



is the energy associated with translational motion. Kinetic energy is a form of energy associated with the motion of a particle, single body, or system of objects moving together.

We are aware that it takes energy to get an object, like a car or the package in Figure 7.4, up to speed, but it may be a bit surprising that kinetic energy is proportional to speed squared. This proportionality means, for example, that a car traveling at  has four times the kinetic energy it has at  , helping to explain why high-speed collisions are so devastating. We will now consider a series of examples to illustrate various aspects of work and energy.

# EXAMPLE 7.2

# Calculating the Kinetic Energy of a Package

Suppose a  package on the roller belt conveyor system in Figure 7.4 is moving at  . What is its kinetic energy?

# Strategy

Because the mass  and speed  are given, the kinetic energy can be calculated from its definition as given in the equation  .

# Solution

The kinetic energy is given by



Entering known values gives

which yields



# Discussion

Note that the unit of kinetic energy is the joule, the same as the unit of work, as mentioned when work was first defined. It is also interesting that, although this is a fairly massive package, its kinetic energy is not large at this relatively low speed. This fact is consistent with the observation that people can move packages like this without exhausting themselves.

# EXAMPLE 7.3

# Determining the Work to Accelerate a Package

Suppose that you push on the  package in Figure 7.4 with a constant force of 120 N through a distance of  , and that the opposing friction force averages 5.00 N.

(a) Calculate the net work done on the package. (b) Solve the same problem as in part (a), this time by finding the work done by each force that contributes to the net force.

# Strategy and Concept for (a)

This is a motion in one dimension problem, because the downward force (from the weight of the package) and the normal force have equal magnitude and opposite direction, so that they cancel in calculating the net force, while the applied force, friction, and the displacement are all horizontal. (See Figure 7.4.) As expected, the net work is the net force times distance.

# Solution for (a)

The net force is the push force minus friction, or  . Thus the net work is



# Discussion for (a)

This value is the net work done on the package. The person actually does more work than this, because friction opposes the motion. Friction does negative work and removes some of the energy the person expends and converts it to thermal energy. The net work equals the sum of the work done by each individual force.

# Strategy and Concept for (b)

The forces acting on the package are gravity, the normal force, the force of friction, and the applied force. The normal force and force of gravity are each perpendicular to the displacement, and therefore do no work.

# Solution for (b)

The applied force does work.



The friction force and displacement are in opposite directions, so that  , and the work done by friction is

So the amounts of work done by gravity, by the normal force, by the applied force, and by friction are, respectively,



The total work done as the sum of the work done by each force is then seen to be



# Discussion for (b)

The calculated total work  as the sum of the work by each force agrees, as expected, with the work  done by the net force. The work done by a collection of forces acting on an object can be calculated by either approach.

# EXAMPLE 7.4

# Determining Speed from Work and Energy

Find the speed of the package in Figure 7.4 at the end of the push, using work and energy concepts.

# Strategy

Here the work-energy theorem can be used, because we have just calculated the net work,  , and the initial kinetic energy,  . These calculations allow us to find the final kinetic energy,  , and thus the final speed  .

# Solution

The work-energy theorem in equation form is



Solving for  gives



Thus,



Solving for the final speed as requested and entering known values gives



# Discussion

Using work and energy, we not only arrive at an answer, we see that the final kinetic energy is the sum of the initial kinetic energy and the net work done on the package. This means that the work indeed adds to the energy of the package.# EXAMPLE 7.5

# Work and Energy Can Reveal Distance, Too

How far does the package in Figure 7.4 coast after the push, assuming friction remains constant? Use work and energy considerations.

# Strategy

We know that once the person stops pushing, friction will bring the package to rest. In terms of energy, friction does negative work until it has removed all of the package’s kinetic energy. The work done by friction is the force of friction times the distance traveled times the cosine of the angle between the friction force and displacement; hence, this gives us a way of finding the distance traveled after the person stops pushing.

# Solution

The normal force and force of gravity cancel in calculating the net force. The horizontal friction force is then the net force, and it acts opposite to the displacement, so  . To reduce the kinetic energy of the package to zero, the work  by friction must be minus the kinetic energy that the package started with plus what the package accumulated due to the pushing. Thus  . Furthermore,  cos  , where  is the distance it takes to stop. Thus,



and so



# Discussion

This is a reasonable distance for a package to coast on a relatively friction-free conveyor system. Note that the work done by friction is negative (the force is in the opposite direction of motion), so it removes the kinetic energy.

Some of the examples in this section can be solved without considering energy, but at the expense of missing out on gaining insights about what work and energy are doing in this situation. On the whole, solutions involving energy are generally shorter and easier than those using kinematics and dynamics alone.

# 7.3 Gravitational Potential Energy

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Explain gravitational potential energy in terms of work done against gravity.   
Show that the gravitational potential energy of an object of mass at height  on Earth is given by  .   
Show how knowledge of the potential energy as a function of position can be used to simplify calculations and explain physical phenomena.

# Work Done Against Gravity

Climbing stairs and lifting objects is work in both the scientific and everyday sense—it is work done against the gravitational force. When there is work, there is a transformation of energy. The work done against the gravitational force goes into an important form of stored energy that we will explore in this section.

Let us calculate the work done in lifting an object of mass  through a height  , such as in Figure 7.5. If the object is lifted straight up at constant speed, then the force needed to lift it is equal to its weight . The work done on the mass is then  . We define this to be the gravitational potential energy  put into (or gained by) the object-Earth system. This energy is associated with the state of separation between two objects that attract each other by the gravitational force. For convenience, we refer to this as the  gained by the object, recognizingthat this is energy stored in the gravitational field of Earth. Why do we use the word “system”? Potential energy is a property of a system rather than of a single object—due to its physical position. An object’s gravitational potential is due to its position relative to the surroundings within the Earth-object system. The force applied to the object is an external force, from outside the system. When it does positive work it increases the gravitational potential energy of the system. Because gravitational potential energy depends on relative position, we need a reference level at which to set the potential energy equal to 0. We usually choose this point to be Earth’s surface, but this point is arbitrary; what is important is the difference in gravitational potential energy, because this difference is what relates to the work done. The difference in gravitational potential energy of an object (in the Earth-object system) between two rungs of a ladder will be the same for the first two rungs as for the last two rungs.

# Converting Between Potential Energy and Kinetic Energy

Gravitational potential energy may be converted to other forms of energy, such as kinetic energy. If we release the mass, gravitational force will do an amount of work equal to on it, thereby increasing its kinetic energy by that same amount (by the work-energy theorem). We will find it more useful to consider just the conversion of  to without explicitly considering the intermediate step of work. (See Example 7.7.) This shortcut makes it is easier to solve problems using energy (if possible) rather than explicitly using forces.

  
FIGURE 7.5 (a) The work done to lift the weight is stored in the mass-Earth system as gravitational potential energy. (b) As the weight moves downward, this gravitational potential energy is transferred to the cuckoo clock.

More precisely, we define the change in gravitational potential energy  to be



where, for simplicity, we denote the change in height by  rather than the usual  . Note that  is positive when the final height is greater than the initial height, and vice versa. For example, if a  mass hung from a cuckoo clock is raised  , then its change in gravitational potential energy is



Note that the units of gravitational potential energy turn out to be joules, the same as for work and other forms of energy. As the clock runs, the mass is lowered. We can think of the mass as gradually giving up its 4.90 J ofgravitational potential energy, without directly considering the force of gravity that does the work.

# Using Potential Energy to Simplify Calculations

The equation  applies for any path that has a change in height of  , not just when the mass is lifted straight up. (See Figure 7.6.) It is much easier to calculate (a simple multiplication) than it is to calculate the work done along a complicated path. The idea of gravitational potential energy has the double advantage that it is very broadly applicable and it makes calculations easier. From now on, we will consider that any change in vertical position  of a mass  is accompanied by a change in gravitational potential energy  , and we will avoid the equivalent but more difficult task of calculating work done by or against the gravitational force.

  
FIGURE 7.6 The change in gravitational potential energy  between points A and B is independent of the path.  for any path between the two points. Gravity is one of a small class of forces where the work done by or against the force depends only on the starting and ending points, not on the path between them.

# EXAMPLE 7.6

# The Force to Stop Falling

 person jumps onto the floor from a height of  . If he lands stiffly (with his knee joints compressing by  ), calculate the force on the knee joints.

# Strategy

This person’s energy is brought to zero in this situation by the work done on him by the floor as he stops. The initial  is transformed into as he falls. The work done by the floor reduces this kinetic energy to zero.

# Solution

The work done on the person by the floor as he stops is given by



with a minus sign because the displacement while stopping and the force from floor are in opposite directions  . The floor removes energy from the system, so it does negative work.

The kinetic energy the person has upon reaching the floor is the amount of potential energy lost by falling throughheight :



The distance  that the person’s knees bend is much smaller than the height  of the fall, so the additional change in gravitational potential energy during the knee bend is ignored.

The work  done by the floor on the person stops the person and brings the person’s kinetic energy to zero:



Combining this equation with the expression for  gives



Recalling that  is negative because the person fell down, the force on the knee joints is given by



# Discussion

Such a large force (500 times more than the person’s weight) over the short impact time is enough to break bones. A much better way to cushion the shock is by bending the legs or rolling on the ground, increasing the time over which the force acts. A bending motion of  this way yields a force 100 times smaller than in the example. A kangaroo's hopping shows this method in action. The kangaroo is the only large animal to use hopping for locomotion, but the shock in hopping is cushioned by the bending of its hind legs in each jump.(See Figure 7.7.)

  
FIGURE 7.7 The work done by the ground upon the kangaroo reduces its kinetic energy to zero as it lands. However, by applying the force o the ground on the hind legs over a longer distance, the impact on the bones is reduced. (credit: Chris Samuel, Flickr)

# EXAMPLE 7.7

# Finding the Speed of a Roller Coaster from its Height

(a) What is the final speed of the roller coaster shown in Figure 7.8 if it starts from rest at the top of the  hill and work done by frictional forces is negligible? (b) What is its final speed (again assuming negligible friction) if its initial speed is   
FIGURE 7.8 The speed of a roller coaster increases as gravity pulls it downhill and is greatest at its lowest point. Viewed in terms of energy, the roller-coaster-Earth system’s gravitational potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. If work done by friction is negligible, all  is converted to .

# Strategy

The roller coaster loses potential energy as it goes downhill. We neglect friction, so that the remaining force exerted by the track is the normal force, which is perpendicular to the direction of motion and does no work. The net work on the roller coaster is then done by gravity alone. The loss of gravitational potential energy from moving downward through a distance  equals the gain in kinetic energy. This can be written in equation form as  . Using the equations for  and , we can solve for the final speed  , which is the desired quantity.

# Solution for (a)

Here the initial kinetic energy is zero, so that  . The equation for change in potential energy states that  . Since  is negative in this case, we will rewrite this as  to show the minus sign clearly. Thus,



becomes



Solving for  , we find that mass cancels and that



Substituting known values,



# Solution for (b)

Again  . In this case there is initial kinetic energy, so  . Thus,



Rearranging gives



This means that the final kinetic energy is the sum of the initial kinetic energy and the gravitational potential energy. Mass again cancels, and

This equation is very similar to the kinematics equation  , but it is more general—the kinematics equation is valid only for constant acceleration, whereas our equation above is valid for any path regardless of whether the object moves with a constant acceleration. Now, substituting known values gives



# Discussion and Implications

First, note that mass cancels. This is quite consistent with observations made in Falling Objects that all objects fall at the same rate if friction is negligible. Second, only the speed of the roller coaster is considered; there is no information about its direction at any point. This reveals another general truth. When friction is negligible, the speed of a falling body depends only on its initial speed and height, and not on its mass or the path taken. For example, the roller coaster will have the same final speed whether it falls  straight down or takes a more complicated path like the one in the figure. Third, and perhaps unexpectedly, the final speed in part (b) is greater than in part (a), but by far less than  . Finally, note that speed can be found at any height along the way by simply using the appropriate value of  at the point of interest.

We have seen that work done by or against the gravitational force depends only on the starting and ending points, and not on the path between, allowing us to define the simplifying concept of gravitational potential energy. We can do the same thing for a few other forces, and we will see that this leads to a formal definition of the law of conservation of energy.

# Making Connections: Take-Home Investigation—Converting Potential to Kinetic Energy

One can study the conversion of gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy in this experiment. On a smooth, level surface, use a ruler of the kind that has a groove running along its length and a book to make an incline (see Figure 7.9). Place a marble at the 10-cm position on the ruler and let it roll down the ruler. When it hits the level surface, measure the time it takes to roll one meter. Now place the marble at the 20-cm and the 30-cm positions and again measure the times it takes to roll  on the level surface. Find the velocity of the marble on the level surface for all three positions. Plot velocity squared versus the distance traveled by the marble. What is the shape of each plot? If the shape is a straight line, the plot shows that the marble’s kinetic energy at the bottom is proportional to its potential energy at the release point.

  
FIGURE 7.9 A marble rolls down a ruler, and its speed on the level surface is measured.# 7.4 Conservative Forces and Potential Energy

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Define conservative force, potential energy, and mechanical energy.   
Explain the potential energy of a spring in terms of its compression when Hooke’s law applies.   
Use the work-energy theorem to show how having only conservative forces implies conservation of mechanical energy.

# Potential Energy and Conservative Forces

Work is done by a force, and some forces, such as weight, have special characteristics. A conservative force is one, like the gravitational force, for which work done by or against it depends only on the starting and ending points of a motion and not on the path taken. We can define a potential energy for any conservative force, just as we did for the gravitational force. For example, when you wind up a toy, an egg timer, or an old-fashioned watch, you do work against its spring and store energy in it. (We treat these springs as ideal, in that we assume there is no friction and no production of thermal energy.) This stored energy is recoverable as work, and it is useful to think of it as potential energy contained in the spring. Indeed, the reason that the spring has this characteristic is that its force is u example, as is the energy stored in a spring. We will also see how conservative forces are related to the conservation of energy.

# Potential Energy and Conservative Forces

Potential energy is the energy a system has due to position, shape, or configuration. It is stored energy that is completely recoverable.

A conservative force is one for which work done by or against it depends only on the starting and ending points of a motion and not on the path taken.

We can define a potential energy for any conservative force. The work done against a conservative force to reach a final configuration depends on the configuration, not the path followed, and is the potential energy added.

# Potential Energy of a Spring

First, let us obtain an expression for the potential energy stored in a spring  ). We calculate the work done to stretch or compress a spring that obeys Hooke’s law. (Hooke’s law was examined in Elasticity: Stress and Strain, and states that the magnitude of force  on the spring and the resulting deformation  are proportional,  .) (See Figure 7.10.) For our spring, we will replace  (the amount of deformation produced by a force  ) by the distance  that the spring is stretched or compressed along its length. So the force needed to stretch the spring has magnitude  , where  is the spring’s force constant. The force increases linearly from 0 at the start to  in the fully stretched position. The average force is  . Thus the work done in stretching or compressing the spring is  . Alternatively, we noted in Kinetic Energy and the Work-Energy Theorem that the area under a graph of  vs.  is the work done by the force. In Figure 7.10(c) we see that this area is also  . We therefore define the potential energy of a spring,  , to be



where  is the spring’s force constant and  is the displacement from its undeformed position. The potential energy represents the work done on the spring and the energy stored in it as a result of stretching or compressing it a distance  . The potential energy of the spring  does not depend on the path taken; it depends only on the stretch or squeeze  in the final configuration.  
FIGURE 7.10 (a) An undeformed spring has no  stored in it. (b) The force needed to stretch (or compress) the spring a distance  has a magnitude  , and the work done to stretch (or compress) it is  . Because the force is conservative, this work is stored as potential energy  in the spring, and it can be fully recovered. (c) A graph of  vs.  has a slope of  , and the area under the graph is  . Thus the work done or potential energy stored is  .

The equation  has general validity beyond the special case for which it was derived. Potential energy can be stored in any elastic medium by deforming it. Indeed, the general definition of potential energy is energy due to position, shape, or configuration. For shape or position deformations, stored energy is  , where  is the force constant of the particular system and  is its deformation. Another example is seen in Figure 7.11 for a guitar string.

  
FIGURE 7.11 Work is done to deform the guitar string, giving it potential energy. When released, the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy and back to potential as the string oscillates back and forth. A very small fraction is dissipated as sound energy, slowly removing energy from the string.

# Conservation of Mechanical Energy

Let us now consider what form the work-energy theorem takes when only conservative forces are involved. This will lead us to the conservation of energy principle. The work-energy theorem states that the net work done by all forces acting on a system equals its change in kinetic energy. In equation form, this is



If only conservative forces act, then

where  is the total work done by all conservative forces. Thus,



Now, if the conservative force, such as the gravitational force or a spring force, does work, the system loses potential energy. That is,  . Therefore,



or



This equation means that the total kinetic and potential energy is constant for any process involving only conservative forces. That is,



where i and f denote initial and final values. This equation is a form of the work-energy theorem for conservative forces; it is known as the conservation of mechanical energy principle. Remember that this applies to the extent that all the forces are conservative, so that friction is negligible. The total kinetic plus potential energy of a system is defined to be its mechanical energy,  . In a system that experiences only conservative forces, there is a potential energy associated with each force, and the energy only changes form between and the various types of , with the total energy remaining constant.

# EXAMPLE 7.8

# Using Conservation of Mechanical Energy to Calculate the Speed of a Toy Car

A 0.100-kg toy car is propelled by a compressed spring, as shown in Figure 7.12. The car follows a track that rises  above the starting point. The spring is compressed  and has a force constant of  . Assuming work done by friction to be negligible, find (a) how fast the car is going before it starts up the slope and (b) how fast it is going at the top of the slope.

  
FIGURE 7.12 A toy car is pushed by a compressed spring and coasts up a slope. Assuming negligible friction, the potential energy in the spring is first completely converted to kinetic energy, and then to a combination of kinetic and gravitational potential energy as the car rises. The details of the path are unimportant because all forces are conservative—the car would have the same final speed if it took the alternate path shown.

# Strategy

The spring force and the gravitational force are conservative forces, so conservation of mechanical energy can be used. Thus,



or



where  is the height (vertical position) and  is the compression of the spring. This general statement looks complex but becomes much simpler when we start considering specific situations. First, we must identify the initialand final conditions in a problem; then, we enter them into the last equation to solve for an unknown.

# Solution for (a)

This part of the problem is limited to conditions just before the car is released and just after it leaves the spring. Take the initial height to be zero, so that both  and  are zero. Furthermore, the initial speed  is zero and the final compression of the spring  is zero, and so several terms in the conservation of mechanical energy equation are zero and it simplifies to



In other words, the initial potential energy in the spring is converted completely to kinetic energy in the absence of friction. Solving for the final speed and entering known values yields



# Solution for (b)

One method of finding the speed at the top of the slope is to consider conditions just before the car is released and just after it reaches the top of the slope, completely ignoring everything in between. Doing the same type of analysis to find which terms are zero, the conservation of mechanical energy becomes



This form of the equation means that the spring’s initial potential energy is converted partly to gravitational potential energy and partly to kinetic energy. The final speed at the top of the slope will be less than at the bottom. Solving for  and substituting known values gives



# Discussion

Another way to solve this problem is to realize that the car’s kinetic energy before it goes up the slope is converted partly to potential energy—that is, to take the final conditions in part (a) to be the initial conditions in part (b).

Note that, for conservative forces, we do not directly calculate the work they do; rather, we consider their effects through their corresponding potential energies, just as we did in Example 7.8. Note also that we do not consider details of the path taken—only the starting and ending points are important (as long as the path is not impossible). This assumption is usually a tremendous simplification, because the path may be complicated and forces may vary along the way.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Define nonconservative forces and explain how they affect mechanical energy. Show how the principle of conservation of energy can be applied by treating the conservative forces in terms of their potential energies and any nonconservative forces in terms of the work they do.

# Nonconservative Forces and Friction

Forces are either conservative or nonconservative. Conservative forces were discussed in Conservative Forces and Potential Energy. A nonconservative force is one for which work depends on the path taken. Friction is a good example of a nonconservative force. As illustrated in Figure 7.13, work done against friction depends on the length of the path between the starting and ending points. Because of this dependence on path, there is no potential energy associated with nonconservative forces. An important characteristic is that the work done by a nonconservative force adds or removes mechanical energy from a system. Friction, for example, creates thermal energy that dissipates, removing energy from the system. Furthermore, even if the thermal energy is retained or captured, it cannot be fully converted back to work, so it is lost or not recoverable in that sense as well.

  
FIGURE 7.13 The amount of the happy face erased depends on the path taken by the eraser between points A and B, as does the work done against friction. Less work is done and less of the face is erased for the path in (a) than for the path in (b). The force here is friction, and most of the work goes into thermal energy that subsequently leaves the system (the happy face plus the eraser). The energy expended cannot be fully recovered.

# How Nonconservative Forces Affect Mechanical Energy

canilerayot  v whevativores ct.aple whenrro stop by friction on level ground, it loses kinetic energy, which is dissipated as thermal energy, reducing its mechanical energy. Figure 7.14 compares the effects of conservative and nonconservative forces. We often choose to understand simpler systems such as that described in Figure 7.14(a) first before studying more complicated systems as in Figure 7.14(b).  
FIGURE 7.14 Comparison of the effects of conservative and nonconservative forces on the mechanical energy of a system. (a) A system with only conservative forces. When a rock is dropped onto a spring, its mechanical energy remains constant (neglecting air resistance) because the force in the spring is conservative. The spring can propel the rock back to its original height, where it once again has only potential energy due to gravity. (b) A system with nonconservative forces. When the same rock is dropped onto the ground, it is stopped by nonconservative forces that dissipate its mechanical energy as thermal energy, sound, and surface distortion. The rock has lost mechanical energy.

# How the Work-Energy Theorem Applies

Now let us consider what form the work-energy theorem takes when both conservative and nonconservative forces act. We will see that the work done by nonconservative forces equals the change in the mechanical energy of a system. As noted in Kinetic Energy and the Work-Energy Theorem, the work-energy theorem states that the net work on a system equals the change in its kinetic energy, or  . The net work is the sum of the work by nonconservative forces plus the work by conservative forces. That is,



so that



where  is the total work done by all nonconservative forces and  is the total work done by all conservative forces.

  
FIGURE 7.15 A person pushes a crate up a ramp, doing work on the crate. Friction and gravitational force (not shown) also do work on the crate; both forces oppose the person’s push. As the crate is pushed up the ramp, it gains mechanical energy, implying that the work done by the person is greater than the work done by friction.

Consider Figure 7.15, in which a person pushes a crate up a ramp and is opposed by friction. As in the previous section, we note that work done by a conservative force comes from a loss of gravitational potential energy, so that  . Substituting this equation into the previous one and solving for  gives



This equation means that the total mechanical energy  changes by exactly the amount of work done by nonconservative forces. In Figure 7.15, this is the work done by the person minus the work done by friction. So even if energy is not conserved for the system of interest (such as the crate), we know that an equal amount of work was done to cause the change in total mechanical energy.We rearrange  to obtain



This means that the amount of work done by nonconservative forces adds to the mechanical energy of a system. If  is positive, then mechanical energy is increased, such as when the person pushes the crate up the ramp in Figure 7.15. If  is negative, then mechanical energy is decreased, such as when the rock hits the ground in Figure 7.14(b). If  is zero, then mechanical energy is conserved, and nonconservative forces are balanced. For example, when you push a lawn mower at constant speed on level ground, your work done is removed by the work of friction, and the mower has a constant energy.

# Applying Energy Conservation with Nonconservative Forces

When no change in potential energy occurs, applying  amounts to applying the work-energy theorem by setting the change in kinetic energy to be equal to the net work done on the system, which in the most general case includes both conservative and nonconservative forces. But when seeking instead to find a change in total mechanical energy in situations that involve changes in both potential and kinetic energy, the previous equation  says that you can start by finding the change in mechanical energy that would have resulted from just the conservative forces, including the potential energy changes, and add to it the work done, with the proper sign, by any nonconservative forces involved.

# EXAMPLE 7.9

# Calculating Distance Traveled: How Far a Baseball Player Slides

Consider the situation shown in Figure 7.16, where a baseball player slides to a stop on level ground. Using energy considerations, calculate the distance the  baseball player slides, given that his initial speed is  and the force of friction against him is a constant  .

  
FIGURE 7.16 The baseball player slides to a stop in a distance . In the process, friction removes the player’s kinetic energy by doing an amount of work  equal to the initial kinetic energy.

# Strategy

Friction stops the player by converting his kinetic energy into other forms, including thermal energy. In terms of the work-energy theorem, the work done by friction, which is negative, is added to the initial kinetic energy to reduce it to zero. The work done by friction is negative, because is in the opposite direction of the motion (that is,  , and so  ). Thus  . The equation simplifies to



or



This equation can now be solved for the distance  .# Solution

Solving the previous equation for  and substituting known values yields



# Discussion

The most important point of this example is that the amount of nonconservative work equals the change in mechanical energy. For example, you must work harder to stop a truck, with its large mechanical energy, than to stop a mosquito.

# EXAMPLE 7.10

# Calculating Distance Traveled: Sliding Up an Incline

Suppose that the player from Example 7.9 is running up a hill having a  incline upward with a surface similar to that in the baseball stadium. The player slides with the same initial speed, and the frictional force is still  . Determine how far he slides.

  
FIGURE 7.17 The same baseball player slides to a stop on a  slope.

# Strategy

In this case, the work done by the nonconservative friction force on the player reduces the mechanical energy he has from his kinetic energy at zero height, to the final mechanical energy he has by moving through distance  to reach height  along the hill, with  sin  . This is expressed by the equation



# Solution

The work done by friction is again  ; initially the potential energy is  and the kinetic energy is  ; the final energy contributions are  for the kinetic energy and  d sin  for the potential energy.

Substituting these values gives



Solve this for  to obtain

# Discussion

As might have been expected, the player slides a shorter distance by sliding uphill. Note that the problem could also have been solved in terms of the forces directly and the work energy theorem, instead of using the potential energy. This method would have required combining the normal force and force of gravity vectors, which no longer cancel each other because they point in different directions, and friction, to find the net force. You could then use the net force and the net work to find the distance  that reduces the kinetic energy to zero. By applying conservation of energy and using the potential energy instead, we need only consider the gravitational potential energy , without combining and resolving force vectors. This simplifies the solution considerably.

# Making Connections: Take-Home Investigation—Determining Friction from the Stopping Distance

This experiment involves the conversion of gravitational potential energy into thermal energy. Use the ruler, book, and marble from Take-Home Investigation—Converting Potential to Kinetic Energy. In addition, you will need a foam cup with a small hole in the side, as shown in Figure 7.18. From the  position on the ruler, let the marble roll into the cup positioned at the bottom of the ruler. Measure the distance  the cup moves before stopping. What forces caused it to stop? What happened to the kinetic energy of the marble at the bottom of the ruler? Next, place the marble at the 20-cm and the  positions and again measure the distance the cup moves after the marble enters it. Plot the distance the cup moves versus the initial marble position on the ruler. Is this relationship linear?

With some simple assumptions, you can use these data to find the coefficient of kinetic friction  of the cup on the table. The force of friction  on the cup is  , where the normal force  is just the weight of the cup plus the marble. The normal force and force of gravity do no work because they are perpendicular to the displacement of the cup, which moves horizontally. The work done by friction is  . You will need the mass of the marble as well to calculate its initial kinetic energy.

It is interesting to do the above experiment also with a steel marble (or ball bearing). Releasing it from the same positions on the ruler as you did with the glass marble, is the velocity of this steel marble the same as the velocity of the marble at the bottom of the ruler? Is the distance the cup moves proportional to the mass of the steel and glass marbles?

# 7.6 Conservation of Energy

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Explain the law of the conservation of energy.   
Describe some of the many forms of energy.   
Define efficiency of an energy conversion process as the fraction left as useful energy or work, rather than being transformed, for example, into thermal energy.

# Law of Conservation of Energy

Energy, as we have noted, is conserved, making it one of the most important physical quantities in nature. The law of conservation of energy can be stated as follows:

total remains the same.

We have explored some forms of energy and some ways it can be transferred from one system to another. This exploration led to the definition of two major types of energy—mechanical energy  and energy transferred via work done by nonconservative forces  . But energy takes many other forms, manifesting itself in many different ways, and we need to be able to deal with all of these before we can write an equation for the above general statement of the conservation of energy.

# Other Forms of Energy than Mechanical Energy

At this point, we deal with all other forms of energy by lumping them into a single group called other energy ( ). Then we can state the conservation of energy in equation form as



All types of energy and work can be included in this very general statement of conservation of energy. Kinetic energy is , work done by a conservative force is represented by , work done by nonconservative forces is  , and all other energies are included as . This equation applies to all previous examples; in those situations was constant, and so it subtracted out and was not directly considered.

# Making Connections: Usefulness of the Energy Conservation Principle

The fact that energy is conserved and has many forms makes it very important. You will find that energy is discussed in many contexts, because it is involved in all processes. It will also become apparent that many situations are best understood in terms of energy and that problems are often most easily conceptualized and solved by considering energy.

When does play a role? One example occurs when a person eats. Food is oxidized with the release of carbon dioxide, water, and energy. Some of this chemical energy is converted to kinetic energy when the person moves, to potential energy when the person changes altitude, and to thermal energy (another form of ).# Some of the Many Forms of Energy

What are some other forms of energy? You can probably name a number of forms of energy not yet discussed. Many of these will be covered in later chapters, but let us detail a few here. Electrical energy is a common form that is converted to many other forms and does work in a wide range of practical situations. Fuels, such as gasoline and food, carry chemical energy that can be transferred to a system through oxidation. Chemical fuel can also produce electrical energy, such as in batteries. Batteries can in turn produce light, which is a very pure form of energy. Most energy sources on Earth are in fact stored energy from the energy we receive from the Sun. We sometimes refer to this as radiant energy, or electromagnetic radiation, which includes visible light, infrared, and ultraviolet radiation.

Nuclear energy comes from processes that convert measurable amounts of mass into energy. Nuclear energy is transformed into the energy of sunlight, into electrical energy in power plants, and into the energy of the heat transfer and blast in weapons. Atoms and molecules inside all objects are in random motion. This internal mechanical energy from the random motions is called thermal energy, because it is related to the temperature of the object. These and all other forms of energy can be converted into one another and can do work.

Table 7.1 gives the amount of energy stored, used, or released from various objects and in various phenomena. The range of energies and the variety of types and situations is impressive.

# Problem-Solving Strategies for Energy

You will find the following problem-solving strategies useful whenever you deal with energy. The strategies help in organizing and reinforcing energy concepts. In fact, they are used in the examples presented in this chapter. The familiar general problem-solving strategies presented earlier—involving identifying physical principles, knowns, and unknowns, checking units, and so on—continue to be relevant here.

Step 1. Determine the system of interest and identify what information is given and what quantity is to be calculated. A sketch will help.

Step 2. Examine all the forces involved and determine whether you know or are given the potential energy from the work done by the forces. Then use step 3 or step 4.

Step 3. If you know the potential energies for the forces that enter into the problem, then forces are all conservative, and you can apply conservation of mechanical energy simply in terms of potential and kinetic energy. The equation expressing conservation of energy is



Step 4. If you know the potential energy for only some of the forces, possibly because some of them are nonconservative and do not have a potential energy, or if there are other energies that are not easily treated in terms of force and work, then the conservation of energy law in its most general form must be used.



In most problems, one or more of the terms is zero, simplifying its solution. Do not calculate  , the work done by conservative forces; it is already incorporated in the terms.

Step 5. You have already identified the types of work and energy involved (in step 2). Before solving for the unknown, eliminate terms wherever possible to simplify the algebra. For example, choose  at either the initial or final point, so that  is zero there. Then solve for the unknown in the customary manner.

Step 6. Check the answer to see if it is reasonable. Once you have solved a problem, reexamine the forms of work and energy to see if you have set up the conservation of energy equation correctly. For example, work done against friction should be negative, potential energy at the bottom of a hill should be less than that at the top, and so on. Also check to see that the numerical value obtained is reasonable. For example, the final speed of a skateboarder who coasts down a  -high ramp could reasonably be  , but not  .

# Transformation of Energy

The transformation of energy from one form into others is happening all the time. The chemical energy in food isconverted into thermal energy through metabolism; light energy is converted into chemical energy through photosynthesis. In a larger example, the chemical energy contained in coal is converted into thermal energy as it burns to turn water into steam in a boiler. This thermal energy in the steam in turn is converted to mechanical energy as it spins a turbine, which is connected to a generator to produce electrical energy. (In all of these examples, not all of the initial energy is converted into the forms mentioned. This important point is discussed later in this section.)

Another example of energy conversion occurs in a solar cell. Sunlight impinging on a solar cell (see Figure 7.19) produces electricity, which in turn can be used to run an electric motor. Energy is converted from the primary source of solar energy into electrical energy and then into mechanical energy.

  
FIGURE 7.19 Solar energy is converted into electrical energy by solar cells, which is used to run a motor in this solar-power aircraft. (credit: NASA)

# Efficiency

Even though energy is conserved in an energy conversion process, the output of useful energy or work will be less than the energy input. The efficiency  of an energy conversion process is defined as



Table 7.2 lists some efficiencies of mechanical devices and human activities. In a coal-fired power plant, for example, about  of the chemical energy in the coal becomes useful electrical energy. The other  transforms into other (perhaps less useful) energy forms, such as thermal energy, which is then released to the environment through combustion gases and cooling towers.

# 7.7 Power

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Calculate power by calculating changes in energy over time.   
Examine power consumption and calculations of the cost of energy consumed.

# What is Power?

lo roaring away from the starting line, a volcano blowing its lava into the atmosphere, or a rocket blasting off, as in Figure 7.20.  
FIGURE 7.20 This powerful rocket on the Space Shuttle Endeavor did work and consumed energy at a very high rate. (credit: NASA)

These images of power have in common the rapid performance of work, consistent with the scientific definition of power  as the rate at which work is done.

# Power

Power is the rate at which work is done.



The SI unit for power is the watt ( ), where 1 watt equals 1 joule/second  .

Because work is energy transfer, power is also the rate at which energy is expended. A 60-W light bulb, for example, expends 60 J of energy per second. Great power means a large amount of work or energy developed in a short time. For example, when a powerful car accelerates rapidly, it does a large amount of work and consumes a large amount of fuel in a short time.

# Calculating Power from Energy

# EXAMPLE 7.11

# Calculating the Power to Climb Stairs

What is the power output for a  woman who runs up a  high flight of stairs in 3.50 s, starting from rest but having a final speed of  (See Figure 7.21.)  
FIGURE 7.21 When this woman runs upstairs starting from rest, she converts the chemical energy originally from food into kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy. Her power output depends on how fast she does this.

# Strategy and Concept

The work going into mechanical energy is  . At the bottom of the stairs, we take both and  as initially zero; thus,  , where  is the vertical height of the stairs. Because all terms are given, we can calculate  and then divide it by time to get power.

# Solution

Substituting the expression for  into the definition of power given in the previous equation,  yields



Entering known values yields



# Discussion

The woman does 1764 J of work to move up the stairs compared with only 120 J to increase her kinetic energy;   
thus, most of her power output is required for climbing rather than accelerating.

It is impressive that this woman’s useful power output is slightly less than 1 horsepower  ! People can generate more than a horsepower with their leg muscles for short periods of time by rapidly converting available blood sugar and oxygen into work output. (A horse can put out 1 hp for hours on end.) Once oxygen is depleted, power output decreases and the person begins to breathe rapidly to obtain oxygen to metabolize more food—this is known as the aerobic stage of exercise. If the woman climbed the stairs slowly, then her power output would be much less, although the amount of work done would be the same.

# Making Connections: Take-Home Investigation—Measure Your Power Rating

Determine your own power rating by measuring the time it takes you to climb a flight of stairs. We will ignore the gain in kinetic energy, as the above example showed that it was a small portion of the energy gain. Don’t expectthat your output will be more than about 0.5 hp.

# Examples of Power

Examples of power are limited only by the imagination, because there are as many types as there are forms of work and energy. (See Table 7.3 for some examples.) Sunlight reaching Earth’s surface carries a maximum power of about 1.3 kilowatts per square meter  A tiny fraction of this is retained by Earth over the long term. Our consumption rate of fossil fuels is far greater than the rate at which they are stored, so it is inevitable that they will be depleted. Power implies that energy is transferred, perhaps changing form. It is never possible to change one form completely into another without losing some of it as thermal energy. For example, a 60-W incandescent bulb converts only 5 W of electrical power to light, with 55 W dissipating into thermal energy. Furthermore, the typical electric power plant converts only 35 to  of its fuel into electricity. The remainder becomes a huge amount of thermal energy that must be dispersed as heat transfer, as rapidly as it is created. A coal-fired power plant may produce 1000 megawatts; 1 megawatt (MW) is  of electric power. But the power plant consumes chemical energy at a rate of about 2500 MW, creating heat transfer to the surroundings at a rate of 1500 MW. (See Figure 7.22.)

  
FIGURE 7.22 Tremendous amounts of electric power are generated by coal-fired power plants such as this one in China, but an even larger amount of power goes into heat transfer to the surroundings. The large cooling towers here are needed to transfer heat as rapidly as it is produced. The transfer of heat is not unique to coal plants but is an unavoidable consequence of generating electric power from any fuel—nuclear, coal, oil, natural gas, or the like.

# Power and Energy Consumption

We usually have to pay for the energy we use. It is interesting and easy to estimate the cost of energy for an electrical appliance if its power consumption rate and time used are known. The higher the power consumption rate and the longer the appliance is used, the greater the cost of that appliance. The power consumption rate is  , where  is the energy supplied by the electricity company. So the energy consumed over a time  is



Electricity bills state the energy used in units of kilowatt-hours  which is the product of power in kilowatts and time in hours. This unit is convenient because electrical power consumption at the kilowatt level for hours at a time is typical.

# EXAMPLE 7.12

# Calculating Energy Costs

What is the cost of running a 0.200-kW computer  per day for 30.0 d if the cost of electricity is  0.120$ per 

# Strategy

Cost is based on energy consumed; thus, we must find  from  and then calculate the cost. Because electrical energy is expressed in  , at the start of a problem such as this it is convenient to convert the units into and hours.# Solution

The energy consumed in  is



and the cost is simply given by



# Discussion

The cost of using the computer in this example is neither exorbitant nor negligible. It is clear that the cost is a combination of power and time. When both are high, such as for an air conditioner in the summer, the cost is high.

The motivation to save energy has become more compelling with its ever-increasing price. Armed with the knowledge that energy consumed is the product of power and time, you can estimate costs for yourself and make the necessary value judgments about where to save energy. Either power or time must be reduced. It is most costeffective to limit the use of high-power devices that normally operate for long periods of time, such as water heaters and air conditioners. This would not include relatively high power devices like toasters, because they are on only a few minutes per day. It would also not include electric clocks, in spite of their 24-hour-per-day usage, because they are very low power devices. It is sometimes possible to use devices that have greater efficiencies—that is, devices that consume less power to accomplish the same task. One example is the compact fluorescent light bulb, which produces over four times more light per watt of power consumed than its incandescent cousin.

Modern civilization depends on energy, but current levels of energy consumption and production are not sustainable. The likelihood of a link between global warming and fossil fuel use (with its concomitant production of carbon dioxide), has made reduction in energy use as well as a shift to non-fossil fuels of the utmost importance. Even though energy in an isolated system is a conserved quantity, the final result of most energy transformations is waste heat transfer to the environment, which is no longer useful for doing work. As we will discuss in more detail in Thermodynamics, the potential for energy to produce useful work has been “degraded” in the energy transformation.

# 7.8 Work, Energy, and Power in Humans

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Explain the human body’s consumption of energy when at rest vs. when engaged in activities that do useful work.   
Calculate the conversion of chemical energy in food into useful work.

# Energy Conversion in Humans

Our own bodies, like all living organisms, are energy conversion machines. Conservation of energy implies that the chemical energy stored in food is converted into work, thermal energy, and/or stored as chemical energy in fatty tissue. (See Figure 7.23.) The fraction going into each form depends both on how much we eat and on our level of physical activity. If we eat more than is needed to do work and stay warm, the remainder goes into body fat.  
FIGURE 7.23 Energy consumed by humans is converted to work, thermal energy, and stored fat. By far the largest fraction goes to thermal energy, although the fraction varies depending on the type of physical activity.

# Power Consumed at Rest

The rate at which the body uses food energy to sustain life and to do different activities is called the metabolic rate. The total energy conversion rate of a person at rest is called the basal metabolic rate (BMR) and is divided among various systems in the body, as shown in Table 7.4. The largest fraction goes to the liver and spleen, with the brain coming next. Of course, during vigorous exercise, the energy consumption of the skeletal muscles and heart increase markedly. About  of the calories burned in a day go into these basic functions. The BMR is a function of age, gender, total body weight, and amount of muscle mass (which burns more calories than body fat). Athletes have a greater BMR due to this last factor.

Energy consumption is directly proportional to oxygen consumption because the digestive process is basically one of oxidizing food. We can measure the energy people use during various activities by measuring their oxygen use. (See Figure 7.24.) Approximately  of energy are produced for each liter of oxygen consumed, independent of the type of food. Table 7.5 shows energy and oxygen consumption rates (power expended) for a variety of activities.

# Power of Doing Useful Work

Work done by a person is sometimes called useful work, which is work done on the outside world, such as lifting weights. Useful work requires a force exerted through a distance on the outside world, and so it excludes internal work, such as that done by the heart when pumping blood. Useful work does include that done in climbing stairs or accelerating to a full run, because these are accomplished by exerting forces on the outside world. Forces exerted by the body are nonconservative, so that they can change the mechanical energy  of the system worked upon, and this is often the goal. A baseball player throwing a ball, for example, increases both the ball’s kinetic and potential energy.If a person needs more energy than they consume, such as when doing vigorous work, the body must draw upon the chemical energy stored in fat. So exercise can be helpful in losing fat. However, the amount of exercise needed to produce a loss in fat, or to burn off extra calories consumed that day, can be large, as Example 7.13 illustrates.

# EXAMPLE 7.13

# Calculating Weight Loss from Exercising

If a person who normally requires an average of 12,000 kJ (3000 kcal) of food energy per day consumes 13,000 kJ per day, they will steadily add body fat. How much bicycling per day is required to work off this extra 1000 kJ?

# Solution

Table 7.5 states that 400 W are used when cycling at a moderate speed. The time required to work off 1000 kJ at this rate is then



# Discussion

If this person uses more energy than they consume, the person’s body will obtain the needed energy by metabolizing body fat. If the person uses  but consumes only  , then the amount of fat loss will be



assuming the energy content of fat to be  .

All bodily functions, from thinking to lifting weights, require energy. (See Figure 7.25.) The many small muscle actions accompanying all quiet activity, from sleeping to head scratching, ultimately become thermal energy, as do less visible muscle actions by the heart, lungs, and digestive tract. Shivering, in fact, is an involuntary response to low body temperature that pits muscles against one another to produce thermal energy in the body (and do no work). The kidneys and liver consume a surprising amount of energy, but the biggest surprise of all is that a full  of all energy consumed by the body is used to maintain electrical potentials in all living cells. (Nerve cells use this electrical potential in nerve impulses.) This bioelectrical energy ultimately becomes mostly thermal energy, but some is utilized to power chemical processes such as in the kidneys and liver, and in fat production.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Describe the distinction between renewable and nonrenewable energy sources. Explain why the inevitable conversion of energy to less useful forms makes it necessary to conserve energy resources.

Energy is an important ingredient in all phases of society. We live in a very interdependent world, and access to adequate and reliable energy resources is crucial for economic growth and for maintaining the quality of our lives. But current levels of energy consumption and production are not sustainable. Depending on the data source, estimates indicate that about  of the world’s energy comes from oil, and much of that goes to transportation uses. This is a reduction by a few percentage points from ten years ago. Oil prices are dependent as much upon new (or foreseen) discoveries as they are upon political events and situations around the world. The U.S., with  of the world’s population, consumes  of the world’s oil production per year.

# Renewable and Nonrenewable Energy Sources

The principal energy resources used in the world are shown in Figure 7.26. The fuel mix has changed over the years but now is dominated by oil, although natural gas and solar contributions are increasing. Renewable forms of energy are those sources that cannot be used up, such as water, wind, solar, and biomass. About  of our energy comes from nonrenewable fossil fuels—oil, natural gas, coal. The likelihood of a link between global warming and fossil fuel use, with its production of carbon dioxide through combustion, has made, in the eyes of many scientists, a shift to non-fossil fuels of utmost importance—but it will not be easy.

# The World’s Growing Energy Needs

World energy consumption continues to rise, especially in the developing countries. (See Figure 7.27.) Global demand for energy has tripled in the past 50 years and might triple again in the next 30 years. While much of this growth will come from the rapidly booming economies of China and India, many of the developed countries, especially those in Europe, are hoping to meet their energy needs by expanding the use of renewable sources. Although presently only a small percentage, renewable energy is growing very fast, especially wind energy. For example, Germany plans to meet  of its power and  of its overall energy needs with renewable resources by the year 2030. (See Figure 7.28.) Energy is a key constraint in the rapid economic growth of China and India. In 2003, China surpassed Japan as the world’s second largest consumer of oil. However, over  of this is imported. Unlike most Western countries, coal dominates the commercial energy resources of China, accounting for  of its energy consumption. In 2009 China surpassed the United States as the largest generator of  . In India, the main energy resources are biomass (wood and dung) and coal. Half of India’s oil is imported. About  of India’selectricity is generated by highly polluting coal. Yet there are sizeable strides being made in renewable energy. India has a rapidly growing wind energy base, and it has the largest solar cooking program in the world. China has invested substantially in building solar collection farms as well as hydroelectric plants.

Table 7.6 displays the 2020 commercial energy mix by country for some of the prime energy users in the world. While non-renewable sources dominate, some countries get a sizeable percentage of their electricity from renewable resources. For example, about two-thirds of New Zealand’s electricity demand is met by hydroelectric. Only  of the U.S. electricity is generated by renewable resources, primarily hydroelectric. It is difficult to determine total sources and consumers of energy in many countries, and estimates vary somewhat by data source and type of measurement.

# Energy and Economic Well-being

Economic well-being is dependent upon energy use, and in most countries higher standards of living, as measured by GDP (gross domestic product) per capita, are matched by higher levels of energy consumption per capita. This is borne out in Figure 7.29. Increased efficiency of energy use will change this dependency. A global problem is balancing energy resource development against the harmful effects upon the environment in its extraction and use.

New and diversified energy sources do, however, greatly increase economic opportunity and stability. First, the extensive employment opportunities in renewable energy make it one of the most sustainable and secure fields to enter. Second, renewable energy provides countries and localities with increased levels of resiliency in the face of natural disasters, conflict, or other disruptions. The 21st century has already seen major economic impacts from energy disruptions: Hurricane Katrina, Superstorm Sandy, various wildfires, Hurricane Maria, and the 2021 Texas Winter Storm demonstrate the vulnerability of United States power systems. Diversifying energy sources through renewables and other fossil-fuel alternatives brings power grids and transportation systems back online much more quickly, saving lives and enabling a more swift return to economic operations. And as critical emerging information infrastructure, such as data centers, requires more of the world's energy, supplying those growing systems during normal operations and crises will be increasingly important.

# Conserving Energy

As we finish this chapter on energy and work, it is relevant to draw some distinctions between two sometimes misunderstood terms in the area of energy use. As has been mentioned elsewhere, the “law of the conservation of energy” is a very useful principle in analyzing physical processes. It is a statement that cannot be proven from basic principles, but is a very good bookkeeping device, and no exceptions have ever been found. It states that the total amount of energy in an isolated system will always remain constant. Related to this principle, but remarkably different from it, is the important philosophy of energy conservation. This concept has to do with seeking to decrease the amount of energy used by an individual or group through (1) reduced activities (e.g., turning down thermostats, driving fewer kilometers) and/or (2) increasing conversion efficiencies in the performance of a particular task—such as developing and using more efficient room heaters, cars that have greater miles-per-gallon ratings, energy-efficient compact fluorescent lights, etc.

Since energy in an isolated system is not destroyed or created or generated, one might wonder why we need to be concerned about our energy resources, since energy is a conserved quantity. The problem is that the final result of most energy transformations is waste heat transfer to the environment and conversion to energy forms no longer useful for doing work. To state it in another way, the potential for energy to produce useful work has been “degraded” in the energy transformation. (This will be discussed in more detail in Thermodynamics.)# Glossary

# Section Summary

# 7.1 Work: The Scientific Definition

• Work is the transfer of energy by a force acting on an object as it is displaced. The work  that a force  does on an object is the product of the magnitude  of the force, times the magnitude  of the displacement, times the cosine of the angle  between them. In symbols,  The SI unit for work and energy is the joule (J), where  .

• The work done by a force is zero if the displacement is either zero or perpendicular to the force. The work done is positive if the force and displacement have the same direction, and negative if they have opposite direction.

# 7.2 Kinetic Energy and the Work-Energy Theorem

• The net work  is the work done by the netforce acting on an object. • Work done on an object transfers energy to the object. The translational kinetic energy of an object of mass moving at speed  is  . The work-energy theorem states that the net work  on a system changes its kinetic energy,  .

# 7.3 Gravitational Potential Energy

• Work done against gravity in lifting an object becomes potential energy of the object-Earth system.   
• The change in gravitational potential energy,  , is  , with  being the increase in height and the acceleration due to gravity. The gravitational potential energy of an object near Earth’s surface is due to its position in the massEarth system. Only differences in gravitational potential energy,  , have physical significance. As an object descends without friction, its gravitational potential energy changes into kinetic energy corresponding to increasing speed, so that  .

# 7.4 Conservative Forces and Potential Energy

• A conservative force is one for which work depends only on the starting and ending points of a motion, not on the path taken. We can define potential energy for any conservative force, just as we defined  for the gravitational force.   
The potential energy of a spring is  , where  is the spring’s force constant and  is the displacement from its undeformed position. Mechanical energy is defined to be  for a conservative force. When only conservative forces act on and within a system, the total mechanical energy is constant. In equation form,

• Friction is an example of a nonconservative force that changes mechanical energy into thermal energy. Work  done by a nonconservative force changes the mechanical energy of a system. In equation form,  or, equivalently,  . When both conservative and nonconservative forces act, energy conservation can be applied and used to calculate motion in terms of the known potential energies of the conservative forces and the work done by nonconservative forces, instead of finding the net work from the net force, or having to directly apply Newton’s laws.

# 7.6 Conservation of Energy

• The law of conservation of energy states that the total energy is constant in any process. Energy may change in form or be transferred from one system to another, but the total remains the same. When all forms of energy are considered, conservation of energy is written in equation form as  , where is all other forms of energy besides mechanical energy. Commonly encountered forms of energy include electric energy, chemical energy, radiant energy, nuclear energy, and thermal energy. Energy is often utilized to do work, but it is not possible to convert all the energy of a system to work. The efficiency  of a machine or human is defined to be  , where  is useful work output and  is the energy consumed.

# 7.7 Power

• Power is the rate at which work is done, or in equation form, for the average power  for work  done over a time ,  .   
• The SI unit for power is the watt  , where  . The power of many devices such as electric motors is also often expressed in horsepower (hp), where  .

or  (conservative forces only), where i and f denote initial and final values. This is known as the conservation of mechanical energy.

# 7.5 Nonconservative Forces

• A nonconservative force is one for which work depends on the path.

# 7.8 Work, Energy, and Power in Humans

• The human body converts energy stored in food into work, thermal energy, and/or chemical energy that is stored in fatty tissue. The rate at which the body uses food energy to sustain life and to do different activities is called the metabolic rate, and the corresponding ratewhen at rest is called the basal metabolic rate (BMR)   
The energy included in the basal metabolic rate is divided among various systems in the body, with the largest fraction going to the liver and spleen, and the brain coming next.   
About  of food calories are used to sustain basic body functions included in the basal   
metabolic rate.   
The energy consumption of people during various activities can be determined by measuring their oxygen use, because the digestive process is   
basically one of oxidizing food.

# 7.9 World Energy Use

• The relative use of different fuels to provide energy has changed over the years, but fuel use is currently dominated by oil, although natural gas

and solar contributions are increasing.

• Although non-renewable sources dominate, some countries meet a sizeable percentage of their electricity needs from renewable resources. The United States obtains only about  of its energy from renewable sources, mostly hydroelectric power. Economic well-being is dependent upon energy use, and in most countries higher standards of living, as measured by GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per capita, are matched by higher levels of energy consumption per capita. Even though, in accordance with the law of conservation of energy, energy can never be created or destroyed, energy that can be used to do work is always partly converted to less useful forms, such as waste heat to the environment, in all of our uses of energy for practical purposes.

The manufacturers of an exercise bicycle claim that you can metabolize  of fat per day by vigorously exercising for  per day on their machine. (a) How many kcal are supplied by the metabolization of  of fat? (b) Calculate the kcal/min that you would have to utilize to metabolize fat at the rate of  in  . (c) What is unreasonable about the results? (d) Which premise is unreasonable, or which premises are inconsistent?67. Construct Your Own Problem Consider a person climbing and descending stairs. Construct a problem in which you calculate the long-term rate at which stairs can be climbed considering the mass of the person, his ability to generate power with his legs, and the height of a single stair step. Also consider why the same person can descend stairs at a faster rate for a nearly unlimited time in spite of the fact that very similar forces are exerted going down as going up. (This points to a fundamentally different process for descending versus climbing stairs.)

68. Construct Your Own Problem Consider humans generating electricity by pedaling a device similar to a stationary bicycle. Construct a problem in which you determine the number of people it would take to replace a large electrical generation facility. Among the things to consider are the power output that is reasonable using the legs, rest time, and the need for electricity 24 hours per day. Discuss the practical implications of your results.

69. Integrated Concepts

A 105-kg basketball player crouches down 0.400 m while waiting to jump. After exerting a force on the floor through this  , their feet leave the floor and their center of gravity rises  above its normal standing erect position. (a) Using energy considerations, calculate the player's velocity when they leave the floor. (b) What average force did the player exert on the floor? (Do not neglect the force to support their weight as well as that to accelerate them.) (c) What was the player's power output during the acceleration phase?

70. Critical Thinking Two boxes of the same mass are pressed against pistons that compress and release the boxes on frictionless surfaces. Box A’s piston has a constant force F over a distance  before the box is released while box B starts at zero force and increases linearly to a force of  before releasing the box at a distance of  (a) Which of these boxes has the greatest speed after releasing from the piston? (b) Based on experimental data for trials similar to box A, an equation that fits the data is suggested for the change in kinetic energy,  , which may not be correct:  , where  is a constant with appropriate units,  is the applied force, and  is the distance the piston moves in contact with the box. Is this equation consistent with your answer from part a? Explain why or why not. Does this equation make sense? Explain why or why not. (c) If the applied force of the piston is proportional to the distance in contact with the box, graph the work done on the box vs. the distance in contact with the piston and box.
