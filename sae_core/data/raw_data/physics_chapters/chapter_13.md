INTRODUCTION TO TEMPERATURE, KINETIC THEORY, AND THE GAS LAWS Heat is something familiar to each of us. We feel the warmth of the summer Sun, the chill of a clear summer night, the heat of coffee after a winter stroll, and the cooling effect of our sweat. Heat transfer is maintained by temperature differences. Manifestations of heat transfer—the movement of heat energy from one place or material to another—are apparent throughout the universe. Heat from beneath Earth’s surface is brought to the surface in flows of incandescent lava. The Sun warms Earth’s surface and is the source of much of the energy we find on it. Rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide threaten to trap more of the Sun’s energy, perhaps fundamentally altering the ecosphere. In space, supernovas explode, briefly radiating more heat than an entire galaxy does.

What is heat? How do we define it? How is it related to temperature? What are heat’s effects? How is it related to other forms of energy and to work? We will find that, in spite of the richness of the phenomena, there is a small set of underlying physical principles that unite the subjects and tie them to other fields.

# 13.1 Temperature

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Define temperature.   
Convert temperatures between the Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales.   
Define thermal equilibrium.   
State the zeroth law of thermodynamics.

The concept of temperature has evolved from the common concepts of hot and cold. Human perception of what feels hot or cold is a relative one. For example, if you place one hand in hot water and the other in cold water, and then place both hands in tepid water, the tepid water will feel cool to the hand that was in hot water, and warm to the one that was in cold water. The scientific definition of temperature is less ambiguous than your senses of hot and cold. Temperature is operationally defined to be what we measure with a thermometer. (Many physical quantities are defined solely in terms of how they are measured. We shall see later how temperature is related to the kinetic energies of atoms and molecules, a more physical explanation.) Two accurate thermometers, one placed in hot water and the other in cold water, will show the hot water to have a higher temperature. If they are then placed in the tepid water, both will give identical readings (within measurement uncertainties). In this section, we discuss temperature, its measurement by thermometers, and its relationship to thermal equilibrium. Again, temperature is the quantity measured by a thermometer.

# Misconception Alert: Human Perception vs. Reality

On a cold winter morning, the wood on a porch feels warmer than the metal of your bike. The wood and bicycle are in thermal equilibrium with the outside air, and are thus the same temperature. They feel different because of the difference in the way that they conduct heat away from your skin. The metal conducts heat away from your body faster than the wood does (see more about conductivity in Conduction). This is just one example demonstrating that the human sense of hot and cold is not determined by temperature alone.

Another factor that affects our perception of temperature is humidity. Most people feel much hotter on hot, humid days than on hot, dry days. This is because on humid days, sweat does not evaporate from the skin as efficiently as it does on dry days. It is the evaporation of sweat (or water from a sprinkler or pool) that cools us off.

Any physical property that depends on temperature, and whose response to temperature is reproducible, can be used as the basis of a thermometer. Because many physical properties depend on temperature, the variety of thermometers is remarkable. For example, volume increases with temperature for most substances. This property is the basis for the common alcohol thermometer, the old mercury thermometer, and the bimetallic strip (Figure 13.3). Other properties used to measure temperature include electrical resistance and color, as shown in Figure 13.4, and the emission of infrared radiation, as shown in Figure 13.5.  
FIGURE 13.3 The curvature of a bimetallic strip depends on temperature. (a) The strip is straight at the starting temperature, where its two components have the same length. (b) At a higher temperature, this strip bends to the right, because the metal on the left has expanded more than the metal on the right.

When the plastic thermometer is exposed to temperature that increases to  , the first liquid crystal square changes color. When the temperature increases above  the second liquid crystal square also changes color, and so forth. (credit: Arkrishna, Wikimedia Commons)

Infrared radiation (whose emission varies with temperature) from the vent is measured and a temperature readout is quickly produced. Infrared measurements are also frequently used as a measure of body temperature. These modern thermometers, placed in the ear canal, are more accurate than alcohol thermometers placed under the tongue or in the armpit. (credit: Lamel J. Hinton/U.S. Navy)

# Temperature Scales

Thermometers are used to measure temperature according to well-defined scales of measurement, which use predefined reference points to help compare quantities. The three most common temperature scales are the Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin scales. A temperature scale can be created by identifying two easily reproducible temperatures. The freezing and boiling temperatures of water at standard atmospheric pressure are commonly used.

The Celsius scale (which replaced the slightly different centigrade scale) has the freezing point of water at  and the boiling point at  . Its unit is the degree Celsius  . On the Fahrenheit scale (still the most frequently used in the United States), the freezing point of water is at  and the boiling point is at  . The unit of temperatureon this scale is the degree Fahrenheit  . Note that a temperature difference of one degree Celsius is greater than a temperature difference of one degree Fahrenheit. Only 100 Celsius degrees span the same range as 180 Fahrenheit degrees, thus one degree on the Celsius scale is 1.8 times larger than one degree on the Fahrenheit scale 

The Kelvin scale is the temperature scale that is commonly used in science. It is an absolute temperature scale defined to have  at the lowest possible temperature, called absolute zero. The official temperature unit on this scale is the kelvin, which is abbreviated K, and is not accompanied by a degree sign. The freezing and boiling points of water are  and  , respectively. Thus, the magnitude of temperature differences is the same in units of kelvins and degrees Celsius. Unlike other temperature scales, the Kelvin scale is an absolute scale. It is used extensively in scientific work because a number of physical quantities, such as the volume of an ideal gas, are directly related to absolute temperature. The kelvin is the SI unit used in scientific work.

  
FIGURE 13.6 Relationships between the Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin temperature scales, rounded to the nearest degree. The relative sizes of the scales are also shown.

The relationships between the three common temperature scales is shown in Figure  . Temperatures on these scales can be converted using the equations in Table 13.1.

Notice that the conversions between Fahrenheit and Kelvin look quite complicated. In fact, they are simple combinations of the conversions between Fahrenheit and Celsius, and the conversions between Celsius and Kelvin.# EXAMPLE 13.1

# EXAMPLE 13.2

# Converting between Temperature Scales: the Reaumur Scale

The Reaumur scale is a temperature scale that was used widely in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries. On the Reaumur temperature scale, the freezing point of water is  and the boiling temperature is  . If “room temperature” is  on the Celsius scale, what is it on the Reaumur scale?

# Strategy

To answer this question, we must compare the Reaumur scale to the Celsius scale. The difference between the freezing point and boiling point of water on the Reaumur scale is  . On the Celsius scale it is  . Therefore  . Both scales start at  for freezing, so we can derive a simple formula to convert between temperatures on the two scales.

# Solution

1. Derive a formula to convert from one scale to the other:



2. Plug the known value into the equation and solve:



# Temperature Ranges in the Universe

Figure 13.8 shows the wide range of temperatures found in the universe. Human beings have been known to survivewith body temperatures within a small range, from  to  b  to  ). The average normal body temperature is usually given as   , and variations in this temperature can indicate a medical condition: a fever, an infection, a tumor, or circulatory problems (see Figure 13.7).

  
FIGURE 13.7 This image of radiation from a person’s body (an infrared thermograph) shows the location of temperature abnormalities in the upper body. Dark blue corresponds to cold areas and red to white corresponds to hot areas. An elevated temperature might be an indication of malignant tissue (a cancerous tumor in the breast, for example), while a depressed temperature might be due to a decline in blood flow from a clot. In this case, the abnormalities are caused by a condition called hyperhidrosis. (credit: Porcelina81, Wikimedia Commons)

The lowest temperatures ever recorded have been measured during laboratory experiments:  at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (USA), and  at Helsinki University of Technology (Finland). In comparison, the coldest recorded place on Earth’s surface is Vostok, Antarctica at  , and the coldest place (outside the lab) known in the universe is the Boomerang Nebula, with a temperature of  .  
FIGURE 13.8 Each increment on this logarithmic scale indicates an increase by a factor of ten, and thus illustrates the tremendous range of temperatures in nature. Note that zero on a logarithmic scale would occur off the bottom of the page at infinity.

# Making Connections: Absolute Zero

What is absolute zero? Absolute zero is the temperature at which all molecular motion has ceased. The concept of absolute zero arises from the behavior of gases. Figure 13.9 shows how the pressure of gases at a constant volume decreases as temperature decreases. Various scientists have noted that the pressures of gases extrapolate to zero at the same temperature,  . This extrapolation implies that there is a lowest temperature. This temperature is called absolute zero. Today we know that most gases first liquefy and then freeze, and it is not actually possible to reach absolute zero. The numerical value of absolute zero temperature is  or  .  
FIGURE 13.9 Graph of pressure versus temperature for various gases kept at a constant volume. Note that all of the graphs extrapolate to zero pressure at the same temperature.

# Thermal Equilibrium and the Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics

Thermometers actually take their own temperature, not the temperature of the object they are measuring. This raises the question of how we can be certain that a thermometer measures the temperature of the object with which it is in contact. It is based on the fact that any two systems placed in thermal contact (meaning heat transfer can occur between them) will reach the same temperature. That is, heat will flow from the hotter object to the cooler one until they have exactly the same temperature. The objects are then in thermal equilibrium, and no further changes will occur. The systems interact and change because their temperatures differ, and the changes stop once their temperatures are the same. Thus, if enough time is allowed for this transfer of heat to run its course, the temperature a thermometer registers does represent the system with which it is in thermal equilibrium. Thermal equilibrium is established when two bodies are in contact with each other and can freely exchange energy.

Furthermore, experimentation has shown that if two systems, A and B, are in thermal equilibrium with each another, and B is in thermal equilibrium with a third system C, then A is also in thermal equilibrium with C. This conclusion may seem obvious, because all three have the same temperature, but it is basic to thermodynamics. It is called the zeroth law of thermodynamics.

# The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics

If two systems, A and B, are in thermal equilibrium with each other, and B is in thermal equilibrium with a third system, C, then A is also in thermal equilibrium with C.

This law was postulated in the 1930s, after the first and second laws of thermodynamics had been developed and named. It is called the zeroth law because it comes logically before the first and second laws (discussed in Thermodynamics). Suppose, for example, a cold metal block and a hot metal block are both placed on a metal plate at room temperature. Eventually the cold block and the plate will be in thermal equilibrium. In addition, the hot block and the plate will be in thermal equilibrium. By the zeroth law, we can conclude that the cold block and the hot block are also in thermal equilibrium.

# CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING

Does the temperature of a body depend on its size?

# Solution

No, the system can be divided into smaller parts each of which is at the same temperature. We say that the temperature is an intensive quantity. Intensive quantities are independent of size.# 13.2 Thermal Expansion of Solids and Liquids

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Define and describe thermal expansion.   
Calculate the linear expansion of an object given its initial length, change in temperature, and coefficient of linear expansion.   
Calculate the volume expansion of an object given its initial volume, change in temperature, and coefficient of volume expansion.   
Calculate thermal stress on an object given its original volume, temperature change, volume change, and bulk modulus.

The expansion of alcohol in a thermometer is one of many commonly encountered examples of thermal expansion, the change in size or volume of a given mass with temperature. Hot air rises because its volume increases, which causes the hot air’s density to be smaller than the density of surrounding air, causing a buoyant (upward) force on the hot air. The same happens in all liquids and gases, driving natural heat transfer upwards in homes, oceans, and weather systems. Solids also undergo thermal expansion. Railroad tracks and bridges, for example, have expansion joints to allow them to freely expand and contract with temperature changes.

What are the basic properties of thermal expansion? First, thermal expansion is clearly related to temperature change. The greater the temperature change, the more a bimetallic strip will bend. Second, it depends on the material. In a thermometer, for example, the expansion of alcohol is much greater than the expansion of the glass containing it.

What is the underlying cause of thermal expansion? As is discussed in Kinetic Theory: Atomic and Molecular Explanation of Pressure and Temperature, an increase in temperature implies an increase in the kinetic energy of the individual atoms. In a solid, unlike in a gas, the atoms or molecules are closely packed together, but their kinetic energy (in the form of small, rapid vibrations) pushes neighboring atoms or molecules apart from each other. This neighbor-to-neighbor pushing results in a slightly greater distance, on average, between neighbors, and adds up to a larger size for the whole body. For most substances under ordinary conditions, there is no preferred direction, and an increase in temperature will increase the solid’s size by a certain fraction in each dimension.

# Linear Thermal Expansion—Thermal Expansion in One Dimension

The change in length  is proportional to length  . The dependence of thermal expansion on temperature, substance, and length is summarized in the equation

where  is the change in length  ,  is the change in temperature, and  is the coefficient of linear expansion, which varies slightly with temperature.

Table 13.2 lists representative values of the coefficient of linear expansion, which may have units of  or  . Because the size of a kelvin and a degree Celsius are the same, both  and  can be expressed in units of kelvins or degrees Celsius. The equation  is accurate for small changes in temperature and can be used for large changes in temperature if an average value of  is used.

# EXAMPLE 13.3

# Calculating Linear Thermal Expansion: The Golden Gate Bridge

The main span of San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge is  long at its coldest. The bridge is exposed to temperatures ranging from  to  . What is its change in length between these temperatures? Assume that the bridge is made entirely of steel.

# Strategy

Use the equation for linear thermal expansion  to calculate the change in length ,  . Use the coefficient of linear expansion,  , for steel from Table 13.2, and note that the change in temperature,  , is  .

# Solution

Plug all of the known values into the equation to solve for  .



# Discussion

Although not large compared with the length of the bridge, this change in length is observable. It is generally spread over many expansion joints so that the expansion at each joint is small.

# Thermal Expansion in Two and Three Dimensions

Objects expand in all dimensions, as illustrated in Figure 13.11. That is, their areas and volumes, as well as their lengths, increase with temperature. Holes also get larger with temperature. If you cut a hole in a metal plate, the remaining material will expand exactly as it would if the plug was still in place. The plug would get bigger, and so the hole must get bigger too. (Think of the ring of neighboring atoms or molecules on the wall of the hole as pushing each other farther apart as temperature increases. Obviously, the ring of neighbors must get slightly larger, so the hole gets slightly larger).

# Thermal Expansion in Two Dimensions

For small temperature changes, the change in area  is given by

where is the change in area  ,  is the change in temperature, and  is the coefficient of linear expansion, which varies slightly with temperature.

  
FIGURE 13.11 In general, objects expand in all directions as temperature increases. In these drawings, the original boundaries of the objects are shown with solid lines, and the expanded boundaries with dashed lines. (a) Area increases because both length and width increase. The area of a circular plug also increases. (b) If the plug is removed, the hole it leaves becomes larger with increasing temperature, just as if the expanding plug were still in place. (c) Volume also increases, because all three dimensions increase.

# Thermal Expansion in Three Dimensions

The change in volume  is very nearly  This equation is usually written as



where  is the coefficient of volume expansion and  . Note that the values of  in Table 13.2 are almost exactly equal to  .

In general, objects will expand with increasing temperature. Water is the most important exception to this rule. Water expands with increasing temperature (its density decreases) when it is at temperatures greater than  . However, it expands with decreasing temperature when it is between  and  to  . Water is densest at  . (See Figure 13.12.) Perhaps the most striking effect of this phenomenon is the freezing of water in a pond. When water near the surface cools down to  it is denser than the remaining water and thus will sink to the bottom. This “turnover” results in a layer of warmer water near the surface, which is then cooled. Eventually the pond has a uniform temperature of  . If the temperature in the surface layer drops below  , the water is less dense than the water below, and thus stays near the top. As a result, the pond surface can completely freeze over. The ice on top of liquid water provides an insulating layer from winter’s harsh exterior air temperatures. Fish and other aquatic life can survive in  water beneath ice, due to this unusual characteristic of water. It also produces circulation of water in the pond that is necessary for a healthy ecosystem of the body of water.

  
FIGURE 13.12 The density of water as a function of temperature. Note that the thermal expansion is actually very small. The maximum density at  is only  greater than the density at  , and  greater than that at  .# Making Connections: Real-World Connections—Filling the Tank

Differences in the thermal expansion of materials can lead to interesting effects at the gas station. One example is the dripping of gasoline from a freshly filled tank on a hot day. Gasoline starts out at the temperature of the ground under the gas station, which is cooler than the air temperature above. The gasoline cools the steel tank when it is filled. Both gasoline and steel tank expand as they warm to air temperature, but gasoline expands much more than steel, and so it may overflow.

This difference in expansion can also cause problems when interpreting the gasoline gauge. The actual amount (mass) of gasoline left in the tank when the gauge hits “empty” is a lot less in the summer than in the winter. The gasoline has the same volume as it does in the winter when the “add fuel” light goes on, but because the gasoline has expanded, there is less mass. If you are used to getting another 40 miles on “empty” in the winter, beware—you will probably run out much more quickly in the summer.

  
FIGURE 13.13 Because the gas expands more than the gas tank with increasing temperature, you can’t drive as many miles on “empty” in the summer as you can in the winter. (credit: Hector Alejandro, Flickr)

# EXAMPLE 13.4

# Calculating Thermal Expansion: Gas vs. Gas Tank

Suppose your  (15.9-gal) steel gasoline tank is full of gas, so both the tank and the gasoline have a temperature of  . How much gasoline has spilled by the time they warm to 

# Strategy

The tank and gasoline increase in volume, but the gasoline increases more, so the amount spilled is the difference in their volume changes. (The gasoline tank can be treated as solid steel.) We can use the equation for volume expansion to calculate the change in volume of the gasoline and of the tank.

# Solution

1. Use the equation for volume expansion to calculate the increase in volume of the steel tank:



2. The increase in volume of the gasoline is given by this equation:



3. Find the difference in volume to determine the amount spilled as



Alternatively, we can combine these three equations into a single equation. (Note that the original volumes are equal.)

# Discussion

This amount is significant, particularly for a  tank. The effect is so striking because the gasoline and steel expand quickly. The rate of change in thermal properties is discussed in Heat and Heat Transfer Methods.

If you try to cap the tank tightly to prevent overflow, you will find that it leaks anyway, either around the cap or by bursting the tank. Tightly constricting the expanding gas is equivalent to compressing it, and both liquids and solids resist being compressed with extremely large forces. To avoid rupturing rigid containers, these containers have air gaps, which allow them to expand and contract without stressing them.

# Thermal Stress

Thermal stress is created by thermal expansion or contraction (see Elasticity: Stress and Strain for a discussion of stress and strain). Thermal stress can be destructive, such as when expanding gasoline ruptures a tank. It can also be useful, for example, when two parts are joined together by heating one in manufacturing, then slipping it over the other and allowing the combination to cool. Thermal stress can explain many phenomena, such as the weathering of rocks and pavement by the expansion of ice when it freezes.

# EXAMPLE 13.5

# Calculating Thermal Stress: Gas Pressure

What pressure would be created in the gasoline tank considered in Example 13.4, if the gasoline increases in temperature from  to  without being allowed to expand? Assume that the bulk modulus  for gasoline is  . (For more on bulk modulus, see Elasticity: Stress and Strain.)

# Strategy

To solve this problem, we must use the following equation, which relates a change in volume  to pressure:



where  is pressure,  is the original volume, and  is the bulk modulus of the material involved. We will use the amount spilled in Example 13.4 as the change in volume,  .

# Solution

1. Rearrange the equation for calculating pressure:



2. Insert the known values. The bulk modulus for gasoline is  . In the previous example, the change in volume  is the amount that would spill. Here,  is the original volume of the gasoline. Substituting these values into the equation, we obtain



# Discussion

This pressure is about  , much more than a gasoline tank can handle.

Forces and pressures created by thermal stress are typically as great as that in the example above. Railroad tracksand roadways can buckle on hot days if they lack sufficient expansion joints. (See Figure 13.14.) Power lines sag more in the summer than in the winter, and will snap in cold weather if there is insufficient slack. Cracks open and close in plaster walls as a house warms and cools. Glass cooking pans will crack if cooled rapidly or unevenly, because of differential contraction and the stresses it creates. (Pyrex® is less susceptible because of its small coefficient of thermal expansion.) Nuclear reactor pressure vessels are threatened by overly rapid cooling, and although none have failed, several have been cooled faster than considered desirable. Biological cells are ruptured when foods are frozen, detracting from their taste. Repeated thawing and freezing accentuate the damage. Even the oceans can be affected. A significant portion of the rise in sea level that is resulting from global warming is due to the thermal expansion of sea water.

Metal is regularly used in the human body for hip and knee implants. Most implants need to be replaced over time because, among other things, metal does not bond with bone. Researchers are trying to find better metal coatings that would allow metal-to-bone bonding. One challenge is to find a coating that has an expansion coefficient similar to that of metal. If the expansion coefficients are too different, the thermal stresses during the manufacturing process lead to cracks at the coating-metal interface.

Another example of thermal stress is found in the mouth. Dental fillings can expand differently from tooth enamel. It can give pain when eating ice cream or having a hot drink. Cracks might occur in the filling. Metal fillings (gold, silver, etc.) are being replaced by composite fillings (porcelain), which have smaller coefficients of expansion, and are closer to those of teeth.

# CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING

Two blocks, A and B, are made of the same material. Block A has dimensions  and Block B has dimensions  . If the temperature changes, what is (a) the change in the volume of the two blocks, (b) the change in the cross-sectional area  , and (c) the change in the height  of the two blocks?

# Solution

(a) The change in volume is proportional to the original volume. Block A has a volume of  . Block B has a volume of  which is 4 times that of Block A. Thus the change in volume of Block B should be 4 times the change in volume of Block A.

(b) The change in area is proportional to the area. The cross-sectional area of Block A is  while that of Block B is  Because cross-sectional area of Block B is twice that of Block A, the change in the cross-sectional area of Block B is twice that of Block A.

(c) The change in height is proportional to the original height. Because the original height of Block B is twice that of A, the change in the height of Block B is twice that of Block A.

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

State the ideal gas law in terms of molecules and in terms of moles.   
Use the ideal gas law to calculate pressure change, temperature change, volume change, or the number of molecules or moles in a given volume.   
Use Avogadro’s number to convert between number of molecules and number of moles.

In this section, we continue to explore the thermal behavior of gases. In particular, we examine the characteristics of atoms and molecules that compose gases. (Most gases, for example nitrogen,  , and oxygen,  , are composed of two or more atoms. We will primarily use the term “molecule” in discussing a gas because the term can also be applied to monatomic gases, such as helium.)

Gases are easily compressed. We can see evidence of this in Table 13.2, where you will note that gases have the ctnncy with temperature changes. In addition, you will note that most gases expand at the same rate, or have the same  . This raises the question as to why gases should all act in nearly the same way, when liquids and solids have widely varying expansion rates.

The answer lies in the large separation of atoms and molecules in gases, compared to their sizes, as illustrated in Figure 13.17. Because atoms and molecules have large separations, forces between them can be ignored, except when they collide with each other during collisions. The motion of atoms and molecules (at temperatures well above the boiling temperature) is fast, such that the gas occupies all of the accessible volume and the expansion of gases is rapid. In contrast, in liquids and solids, atoms and molecules are closer together and are quite sensitive to theforces between them.

  
FIGURE 13.17 Atoms and molecules in a gas are typically widely separated, as shown. Because the forces between them are quite weak at these distances, the properties of a gas depend more on the number of atoms per unit volume and on temperature than on the type of atom.

To get some idea of how pressure, temperature, and volume of a gas are related to one another, consider what happens when you pump air into an initially deflated tire. The tire’s volume first increases in direct proportion to the amount of air injected, without much increase in the tire pressure. Once the tire has expanded to nearly its full size, the walls limit volume expansion. If we continue to pump air into it, the pressure increases. The pressure will further increase when the car is driven and the tires move. Most manufacturers specify optimal tire pressure for cold tires. (See Figure 13.18.)

  
FIGURE 13.18 (a) When air is pumped into a deflated tire, its volume first increases without much increase in pressure. (b) When the tire is filled to a certain point, the tire walls resist further expansion and the pressure increases with more air. (c) Once the tire is inflated, its pressure increases with temperature.

At room temperatures, collisions between atoms and molecules can be ignored. In this case, the gas is called an ideal gas, in which case the relationship between the pressure, volume, and temperature is given by the equation of state called the ideal gas law.

# Ideal Gas Law

The ideal gas law states that



where  is the absolute pressure of a gas,  is the volume it occupies,  is the number of atoms and molecules in the gas, and  is its absolute temperature. The constant  is called the Boltzmann constant in honor of Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann (1844–1906) and has the value



The ideal gas law can be derived from basic principles, but was originally deduced from experimental measurements of Charles’ law (that volume occupied by a gas is proportional to temperature at a fixed pressure) and from Boyle’s law (that for a fixed temperature, the product  is a constant). In the ideal gas model, the volume occupied by its atoms and molecules is a negligible fraction of  . The ideal gas law describes the behavior of real gases under most conditions. (Note, for example, that  is the total number of atoms and molecules, independent of the type of gas.)

Let us see how the ideal gas law is consistent with the behavior of filling the tire when it is pumped slowly and the temperature is constant. At first, the pressure  is essentially equal to atmospheric pressure, and the volume increases in direct proportion to the number of atoms and molecules  put into the tire. Once the volume of the tire is constant, the equation  predicts that the pressure should increase in proportion to the number N of# EXAMPLE 13.6

# Calculating Pressure Changes Due to Temperature Changes: Tire Pressure

Suppose your bicycle tire is fully inflated, with an absolute pressure of  (a gauge pressure of just under  ) at a temperature of  . What is the pressure after its temperature has risen to  Assume that there are no appreciable leaks or changes in volume.

# Strategy

The pressure in the tire is changing only because of changes in temperature. First we need to identify what we know and what we want to know, and then identify an equation to solve for the unknown.

We know the initial pressure  , the initial temperature  , and the final temperature  . We must find the final pressure  . How can we use the equation  At first, it may seem that not enough information is given, because the volume  and number of atoms  are not specified. What we can do is use the equation twice:  and  . If we divide  by  we can come up with an equation that allows us to solve for  .



Since the volume is constant,  and  are the same and they cancel out. The same is true for  and  , and  , which is a constant. Therefore,



We can then rearrange this to solve for  :



where the temperature must be in units of kelvins, because  and  are absolute temperatures.

# Solution

1. Convert temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin.



2. Substitute the known values into the equation.



# Discussion

The final temperature is about  greater than the original temperature, so the final pressure is about  greater as well. Note that absolute pressure and absolute temperature must be used in the ideal gas law.

# Calculating the Number of Molecules in a Cubic Meter of Gas

How many molecules are in a typical object, such as gas in a tire or water in a drink? We can use the ideal gas law to give us an idea of how large  typically is.

Calculate the number of molecules in a cubic meter of gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP), which is defined to be  and atmospheric pressure.

2. Identify the unknown: number of molecules,  .

3. Rearrange the ideal gas law to solve for  .



4. Substitute the known values into the equation and solve for  .



# Discussion

This number is undeniably large, considering that a gas is mostly empty space.  is huge, even in small volumes. For example,  of a gas at STP has  molecules in it. Once again, note that  is the same for all types or mixtures of gases.

# Moles and Avogadro’s Number

It is sometimes convenient to work with a unit other than molecules when measuring the amount of substance. A mole (abbreviated mol) is defined to be the amount of a substance that contains as many atoms or molecules as there are atoms in exactly 12 grams  of carbon-12. The actual number of atoms or molecules in one mole is called Avogadro’s number  , in recognition of Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro (1776–1856). He developed the concept of the mole, based on the hypothesis that equal volumes of gas, at the same pressure and temperature, contain equal numbers of molecules. That is, the number is independent of the type of gas. This hypothesis has been confirmed, and the value of Avogadro’s number is



# Avogadro’s Number

One mole always contains  particles (atoms or molecules), independent of the element or substance. A mole of any substance has a mass in grams equal to its molecular mass, which can be calculatedfrom the atomic masses given in the periodic table of elements.



  
FIGURE 13.19 How big is a mole? On a macroscopic level, one mole of table tennis balls would cover the Earth to a depth of about 

# CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING

The active ingredient in a Tylenol pill is  of acetaminophen  . Find the number of active molecules of acetaminophen in a single pill.

# Solution

We first need to calculate the molar mass (the mass of one mole) of acetaminophen. To do this, we need to multiply the number of atoms of each element by the element’s atomic mass.



Then we need to calculate the number of moles in  .



Then use Avogadro’s number to calculate the number of molecules.



# EXAMPLE 13.8

# Calculating Moles per Cubic Meter and Liters per Mole

Calculate: (a) the number of moles in  of gas at STP, and (b) the number of liters of gas per mole.

# Strategy and Solution

(a) We are asked to find the number of moles per cubic meter, and we know from Example 13.7 that the number of molecules per cubic meter at STP is  . The number of moles can be found by dividing the number of molecules by Avogadro’s number. We let  stand for the number of moles,



(b) Using the value obtained for the number of moles in a cubic meter, and converting cubic meters to liters, we obtain

# Discussion

This value is very close to the accepted value of  . The slight difference is due to rounding errors caused by using three-digit input. Again this number is the same for all gases. In other words, it is independent of the gas.

The (average) molar weight of air (approximately  and  is  Thus the mass of one cubic meter of air is  . If a living room has dimensions  the mass of air inside the room is  which is the typical mass of a human.

# CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING

The density of air at standard conditions  and  is  . At what pressure is the density  if the temperature and number of molecules are kept constant?

# Solution

The best way to approach this question is to think about what is happening. If the density drops to half its original value and no molecules are lost, then the volume must double. If we look at the equation  , we see that when the temperature is constant, the pressure is inversely proportional to volume. Therefore, if the volume doubles, the pressure must drop to half its original value, and  atm.

# The Ideal Gas Law Restated Using Moles

A very common expression of the ideal gas law uses the number of moles,  , rather than the number of atoms and molecules,  . We start from the ideal gas law,



and multiply and divide the equation by Avogadro’s number  . This gives



Note that  is the number of moles. We define the universal gas constant  , and obtain the ideal gas law in terms of moles.

# Ideal Gas Law (in terms of moles)

The ideal gas law (in terms of moles) is



The numerical value of  in SI units is



In other units,



You can use whichever value of  is most convenient for a particular problem.

# EXAMPLE 13.9

# Calculating Number of Moles: Gas in a Bike Tire

How many moles of gas are in a bike tire with a volume of  a pressure of  (a gauge pressure of just under  ), and at a temperature of # Strategy

Identify the knowns and unknowns, and choose an equation to solve for the unknown. In this case, we solve the ideal gas law,  , for the number of moles  .

# Solution

1. Identify the knowns.



2. Rearrange the equation to solve for  and substitute known values.



# Discussion

The most convenient choice for  in this case is  because our known quantities are in SI units. The pressure and temperature are obtained from the initial conditions in Example 13.6, but we would get the same answer if we used the final values.

The ideal gas law can be considered to be another manifestation of the law of conservation of energy (see Conservation of Energy). Work done on a gas results in an increase in its energy, increasing pressure and/or temperature, or decreasing volume. This increased energy can also be viewed as increased internal kinetic energy, given the gas’s atoms and molecules.

# The Ideal Gas Law and Energy

Let us now examine the role of energy in the behavior of gases. When you inflate a bike tire by hand, you do work by repeatedly exerting a force through a distance. This energy goes into increasing the pressure of air inside the tire and increasing the temperature of the pump and the air.

The ideal gas law is closely related to energy: the units on both sides are joules. The right-hand side of the ideal gas law in  is . This term is roughly the amount of translational kinetic energy of  atoms or molecules at an absolute temperature  , as we shall see formally in Kinetic Theory: Atomic and Molecular Explanation of Pressure and Temperature. The left-hand side of the ideal gas law is  which also has the units of joules. We know from our study of fluids that pressure is one type of potential energy per unit volume, so pressure multiplied by volume is energy. The important point is that there is energy in a gas related to both its pressure and its volume. The energy can be changed when the gas is doing work as it expands—something we explore in Heat and Heat Transfer Methods—similar to what occurs in gasoline or steam engines and turbines.

# Problem-Solving Strategy: The Ideal Gas Law

Step 1 Examine the situation to determine that an ideal gas is involved. Most gases are nearly ideal.

Step 2 Make a list of what quantities are given, or can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the known quantities). Convert known values into proper SI units (K for temperature, Pa for pressure,  for volume, molecules for  , and moles for  ).

Step 3 Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknown quantities). A written list is useful.Step 4 Determine whether the number of molecules or the number of moles is known, in order to decide which form of the ideal gas law to use. The first form is  and involves  , the number of atoms or molecules. The second form is  and involves  , the number of moles.

Step 5 Solve the ideal gas law for the quantity to be determined (the unknown quantity). You may need to take a ratio of final states to initial states to eliminate the unknown quantities that are kept fixed.

Step 6 Substitute the known quantities, along with their units, into the appropriate equation, and obtain numerical solutions complete with units. Be certain to use absolute temperature and absolute pressure.

Step 7 Check the answer to see if it is reasonable: Does it make sense?

# CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING

Liquids and solids have densities about 1000 times greater than gases. Explain how this implies that the distances between atoms and molecules in gases are about 10 times greater than the size of their atoms and molecules.

# Solution

Atoms and molecules are close together in solids and liquids. In gases they are separated by empty space. Thus gases have lower densities than liquids and solids. Density is mass per unit volume, and volume is related to the size of a body (such as a sphere) cubed. So if the distance between atoms and molecules increases by a factor of 10, then the volume occupied increases by a factor of 1000, and the density decreases by a factor of 1000.

# 13.4 Kinetic Theory: Atomic and Molecular Explanation of Pressure and Temperature

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Express the ideal gas law in terms of molecular mass and velocity. Define thermal energy. Calculate the kinetic energy of a gas molecule, given its temperature. Describe the relationship between the temperature of a gas and the kinetic energy of atoms and molecules. , Describe the distribution of speeds of molecules in a gas.

We have developed macroscopic definitions of pressure and temperature. Pressure is the force divided by the area on which the force is exerted, and temperature is measured with a thermometer. We gain a better understanding of pressure and temperature from the kinetic theory of gases, which assumes that atoms and molecules are in continuous random motion.  
FIGURE 13.20 When a molecule collides with a rigid wall, the component of its momentum perpendicular to the wall is reversed. A force is thus exerted on the wall, creating pressure.

Figure 13.20 shows an elastic collision of a gas molecule with the wall of a container, so that it exerts a force on the wall (by Newton’s third law). Because a huge number of molecules will collide with the wall in a short time, we observe an average force per unit area. These collisions are the source of pressure in a gas. As the number of molecules increases, the number of collisions and thus the pressure increase. Similarly, the gas pressure is higher if the average velocity of molecules is higher. The actual relationship is derived in the Things Great and Small feature below. The following relationship is found:



where  is the pressure (average force per unit area),  is the volume of gas in the container,  is the number of molecules in the container,  is the mass of a molecule, and  is the average of the molecular speed squared.

What can we learn from this atomic and molecular version of the ideal gas law? We can derive a relationship between temperature and the average translational kinetic energy of molecules in a gas. Recall the previous expression of the ideal gas law:



Equating the right-hand side of this equation with the right-hand side of  gives



# Making Connections: Things Great and Small—Atomic and Molecular Origin of Pressure in a Gas

Figure 13.21 shows a box filled with a gas. We know from our previous discussions that putting more gas into the box produces greater pressure, and that increasing the temperature of the gas also produces a greater pressure. But why should increasing the temperature of the gas increase the pressure in the box? A look at the atomic and molecular scale gives us some answers, and an alternative expression for the ideal gas law.

The figure shows an expanded view of an elastic collision of a gas molecule with the wall of a container. Calculating the average force exerted by such molecules will lead us to the ideal gas law, and to the connection between temperature and molecular kinetic energy. We assume that a molecule is small compared with theseparation of molecules in the gas, and that its interaction with other molecules can be ignored. We also assume the wall is rigid and that the molecule’s direction changes, but that its speed remains constant (and hence its kinetic energy and the magnitude of its momentum remain constant as well). This assumption is not always valid, but the same result is obtained with a more detailed description of the molecule’s exchange of energy and momentum with the wall.

  
FIGURE 13.21 Gas in a box exerts an outward pressure on its walls. A molecule colliding with a rigid wall has the direction of its velocity and momentum in the  -direction reversed. This direction is perpendicular to the wall. The components of its velocity momentum in the  - and  -directions are not changed, which means there is no force parallel to the wall.

If the molecule’s velocity changes in the  -direction, its momentum changes from  to  . Thus, its change in momentum is  . The force exerted on the molecule is given by



There is no force between the wall and the molecule until the molecule hits the wall. During the short time of the collision, the force between the molecule and wall is relatively large. We are looking for an average force; we take  to be the average time between collisions of the molecule with this wall. It is the time it would take the molecule to go across the box and back (a distance at a speed of  . Thus  , and the expression for the force becomes



This force is due to one molecule. We multiply by the number of molecules  and use their average squared velocity to find the force



where the bar over a quantity means its average value. We would like to have the force in terms of the speed  , rather than the  -component of the velocity. We note that the total velocity squared is the sum of the squares of its components, so that



Because the velocities are random, their average components in all directions are the same:

Thus,



or



Substituting  into the expression for  gives



The pressure is  so that we obtain



where we used  for the volume. This gives the important result.



This equation is another expression of the ideal gas law.

We can get the average kinetic energy of a molecule,  , from the right-hand side of the equation by canceling  and multiplying by  . This calculation produces the result that the average kinetic energy of a molecule is directly related to absolute temperature.



The average translational kinetic energy of a molecule,  , is called thermal energy. The equation  is a molecular interpretation of temperature, and it has been found to be valid for gases and reasonably accurate in liquids and solids. It is another definition of temperature based on an expression of the molecular energy.

It is sometimes useful to rearrange  and solve for the average speed of molecules in a gas in terms of temperature,



where  stands for root-mean-square (rms) speed.

# EXAMPLE 13.10

# Calculating Kinetic Energy and Speed of a Gas Molecule

(a) What is the average kinetic energy of a gas molecule at  (room temperature)? (b) Find the rms speed of a nitrogen molecule  at this temperature.

# Strategy for (a)

The known in the equation for the average kinetic energy is the temperature.

Before substituting values into this equation, we must convert the given temperature to kelvins. This conversion gives  

# Solution for (a)

The temperature alone is sufficient to find the average translational kinetic energy. Substituting the temperature into the translational kinetic energy equation gives



# Strategy for (b)

Finding the rms speed of a nitrogen molecule involves a straightforward calculation using the equation



but we must first find the mass of a nitrogen molecule. Using the molecular mass of nitrogen  from the periodic table,



# Solution for (b)

Substituting this mass and the value for  into the equation for  yields



# Discussion

Note that the average kinetic energy of the molecule is independent of the type of molecule. The average translational kinetic energy depends only on absolute temperature. The kinetic energy is very small compared to macroscopic energies, so that we do not feel when an air molecule is hitting our skin. The rms velocity of the nitrogen molecule is surprisingly large. These large molecular velocities do not yield macroscopic movement of air, since the molecules move in all directions with equal likelihood. The mean free path (the distance a molecule can move on average between collisions) of molecules in air is very small, and so the molecules move rapidly but do not get very far in a second. The high value for rms speed is reflected in the speed of sound, however, which is about  at room temperature. The faster the rms speed of air molecules, the faster that sound vibrations can be transferred through the air. The speed of sound increases with temperature and is greater in gases with small molecular masses, such as helium. (See Figure 13.22.)

  
FIGURE 13.22 (a) There are many molecules moving so fast in an ordinary gas that they collide a billion times every second. (b) Individual molecules do not move very far in a small amount of time, but disturbances like sound waves are transmitted at speeds related to the molecular speeds.# Making Connections: Historical Note—Kinetic Theory of Gases

The kinetic theory of gases was developed by Daniel Bernoulli (1700–1782), who is best known in physics for his work on fluid flow (hydrodynamics). Bernoulli’s work predates the atomistic view of matter established by Dalton.

# Distribution of Molecular Speeds

The motion of molecules in a gas is random in magnitude and direction for individual molecules, but a gas of many molecules has a predictable distribution of molecular speeds. This distribution is called the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, te triginators, who calculate baseon kinettheory and has since beenconme experimentally. (See Figure 13.23.) The distribution has a long tail, because a few molecules may go several times the rms speed. The most probable speed  is less than the rms speed  . Figure 13.24 shows that the curve is shifted to higher speeds at higher temperatures, with a broader range of speeds.

  
FIGURE 13.23 The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of molecular speeds in an ideal gas. The most likely speed  is less than the rms speed  . Although very high speeds are possible, only a tiny fraction of the molecules have speeds that are an order of magnitude greater than  .

The distribution of thermal speeds depends strongly on temperature. As temperature increases, the speeds are shifted to higher values and the distribution is broadened.

  
FIGURE 13.24 The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is shifted to higher speeds and is broadened at higher temperatures.

What is the implication of the change in distribution with temperature shown in Figure 13.24 for humans? All other things being equal, if a person has a fever, they are likely to lose more water molecules, particularly from liningsalong moist cavities such as the lungs and mouth, creating a dry sensation in the mouth.

# EXAMPLE 13.11

# Calculating Temperature: Escape Velocity of Helium Atoms

In order to escape Earth’s gravity, an object near the top of the atmosphere (at an altitude of  ) must travel away from Earth at  . This speed is called the escape velocity. At what temperature would helium atoms have an rms speed equal to the escape velocity?

# Strategy

Identify the knowns and unknowns and determine which equations to use to solve the problem.

# Solution

1. Identify the knowns:  is the escape velocity,  .

2. Identify the unknowns: We need to solve for temperature,  . We also need to solve for the mass of the helium atom.

3. Determine which equations are needed.

• To solve for mass  of the helium atom, we can use information from the periodic table:



• To solve for temperature  , we can rearrange either



or



to yield



where  is the Boltzmann constant and  is the mass of a helium atom.

4. Plug the known values into the equations and solve for the unknowns.





# Discussion

This temperature is much higher than atmospheric temperature, which is approximately 250 K  or  at high altitude. Very few helium atoms are left in the atmosphere, but there were many when the atmosphere was formed. The reason for the loss of helium atoms is that there are a small number of helium atoms with speeds higher than Earth’s escape velocity even at normal temperatures. The speed of a helium atom changes from one instant to the next, so that at any instant, there is a small, but nonzero chance that the speed is greater than the escape speed and the molecule escapes from Earth’s gravitational pull. Heavier molecules, such as oxygen, nitrogen, and water (very little of which reach a very high altitude), have smaller rms speeds, and so it is much less likely that any of them will have speeds greater than the escape velocity. In fact, so few have speeds above theescape velocity that billions of years are required to lose significant amounts of the atmosphere. Figure 13.25 shows the impact of a lack of an atmosphere on the Moon. Because the gravitational pull of the Moon is much weaker, it has lost almost its entire atmosphere. The comparison between Earth and the Moon is discussed in this chapter’s Problems and Exercises.

  
FIGURE 13.25 This photograph of Apollo 17 Commander Eugene Cernan driving the lunar rover on the Moon in 1972 looks as though it was taken at night with a large spotlight. In fact, the light is coming from the Sun. Because the acceleration due to gravity on the Moon is so low (about  that of Earth), the Moon’s escape velocity is much smaller. As a result, gas molecules escape very easily from the Moon, leaving it with virtually no atmosphere. Even during the daytime, the sky is black because there is no gas to scatter sunlight.

# CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING

If you consider a very small object such as a grain of pollen, in a gas, then the number of atoms and molecules striking its surface would also be relatively small. Would the grain of pollen experience any fluctuations in pressure due to statistical fluctuations in the number of gas atoms and molecules striking it in a given amount of time?

# Solution

Yes. Such fluctuations actually occur for a body of any size in a gas, but since the numbers of atoms and molecules are immense for macroscopic bodies, the fluctuations are a tiny percentage of the number of collisions, and the averages spoken of in this section vary imperceptibly. Roughly speaking the fluctuations are proportional to the inverse square root of the number of collisions, so for small bodies they can become significant. This was actually observed in the 19th century for pollen grains in water, and is known as the Brownian effect.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Interpret a phase diagram.   
State Dalton’s law.   
Identify and describe the triple point of a gas from its phase diagram.   
Describe the state of equilibrium between a liquid and a gas, a liquid and a solid, and a gas and a solid.

Up to now, we have considered the behavior of ideal gases. Real gases are like ideal gases at high temperatures. At lower temperatures, however, the interactions between the molecules and their volumes cannot be ignored. The molecules are very close (condensation occurs) and there is a dramatic decrease in volume, as seen in Figure 13.26. The substance changes from a gas to a liquid. When a liquid is cooled to even lower temperatures, it becomes a solid. The volume never reaches zero because of the finite volume of the molecules.

  
FIGURE 13.26 A sketch of volume versus temperature for a real gas at constant pressure. The linear (straight line) part of the graph represents ideal gas behavior—volume and temperature are directly and positively related and the line extrapolates to zero volume at  , or absolute zero. When the gas becomes a liquid, however, the volume actually decreases precipitously at the liquefaction point. The volume decreases slightly once the substance is solid, but it never becomes zero.

High pressure may also cause a gas to change phase to a liquid. Carbon dioxide, for example, is a gas at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, but becomes a liquid under sufficiently high pressure. If the pressure is reduced, the temperature drops and the liquid carbon dioxide solidifies into a snow-like substance at the temperature  . Solid  is called “dry ice.” Another example of a gas that can be in a liquid phase is liquid nitrogen  is made by liquefaction of atmospheric air (through compression and cooling). It boils at   at atmospheric pressure.  is useful as a refrigerant and allows for the preservation of blood, sperm, and other biological materials. It is also used to reduce noise in electronic sensors and equipment, and to help cool down their current-carrying wires. In dermatology,  is used to freeze and painlessly remove warts and other growths from the skin.

# PVDiagrams

We can examine aspects of the behavior of a substance by plotting a graph of pressure versus volume, called a PV diagram. When the substance behaves like an ideal gas, the ideal gas law describes the relationship between its pressure and volume. That is,



Now, assuming the number of molecules and the temperature are fixed,



For example, the volume of the gas will decrease as the pressure increases. If you plot the relationship  on a  diagram, you find a hyperbola. Figure 13.27 shows a graph of pressure versus volume. Thehyperbolas represent ideal-gas behavior at various fixed temperatures, and are called isotherms. At lower temperatures, the curves begin to look less like hyperbolas—the gas is not behaving ideally and may even contain liquid. There is a critical point—that is, a critical temperature—above which liquid cannot exist. At sufficiently high pressure above the critical point, the gas will have the density of a liquid but will not condense. Carbon dioxide, for example, cannot be liquefied at a temperature above  . Critical pressure is the minimum pressure needed for liquid to exist at the critical temperature. Table 13.3 lists representative critical temperatures and pressures.

The lower curves are not hyperbolas, because the gas is no longer an ideal gas. (b) An expanded portion of the  diagram for low temperatures, where the phase can change from a gas to a liquid.

# Phase Diagrams

The plots of pressure versus temperatures provide considerable insight into thermal properties of substances. There are well-defined regions on these graphs that correspond to various phases of matter, so  graphs are calledphase diagrams. Figure 13.28 shows the phase diagram for water. Using the graph, if you know the pressure and temperature you can determine the phase of water. The solid lines—boundaries between phases—indicate temperatures and pressures at which the phases coexist (that is, they exist together in ratios, depending on pressure and temperature). For example, the boiling point of water is  at 1.00 atm. As the pressure increases, the boiling temperature rises steadily to  at a pressure of 218 atm. A pressure cooker (or even a covered pot) will cook food faster because the water can exist as a liquid at temperatures greater than  without all boiling away. The curve ends at a point called the critical point, because at higher temperatures the liquid phase does not exist at any pressure. The critical point occurs at the critical temperature, as you can see for water from Table 13.3. The critical temperature for oxygen is  , so oxygen cannot be liquefied above this temperature.

  
FIGURE 13.28 The phase diagram  graph) for water. Note that the axes are nonlinear and the graph is not to scale. This graph is simplified—there are several other exotic phases of ice at higher pressures.

Similarly, the curve between the solid and liquid regions in Figure 13.28 gives the melting temperature at various pressures. For example, the melting point is  at 1.00 atm, as expected. Note that, at a fixed temperature, you can change the phase from solid (ice) to liquid (water) by increasing the pressure. Ice melts from pressure in the hands of a snowball maker. From the phase diagram, we can also say that the melting temperature of ice falls with increased pressure. When a car is driven over snow, the increased pressure from the tires melts the snowflakes; afterwards the water refreezes and forms an ice layer.

At sufficiently low pressures there is no liquid phase, but the substance can exist as either gas or solid. For water, there is no liquid phase at pressures below 0.00600 atm. The phase change from solid to gas is called sublimation. It accounts for large losses of snow pack that never make it into a river, the routine automatic defrosting of a freezer, and the freeze-drying process applied to many foods. Carbon dioxide, on the other hand, sublimates at standard atmospheric pressure of 1 atm. (The solid form of  is known as dry ice because it does not melt. Instead, it moves directly from the solid to the gas state.)

All three curves on the phase diagram meet at a single point, the triple point, where all three phases exist in equilibrium. For water, the triple point occurs at  , and is a more accurate calibration temperature than the melting point of water at 1.00 atm, or  . See Table 13.4 for the triple point values of other substances.

# Equilibrium

Liquid and gas phases are in equilibrium at the boiling temperature. (See Figure 13.29.) If a substance is in a closed container at the boiling point, then the liquid is boiling and the gas is condensing at the same rate without net change in their relative amount. Molecules in the liquid escape as a gas at the same rate at which gas molecules stick to the liquid, or form droplets and become part of the liquid phase. The combination of temperature and pressure has to be “just right”; if the temperature and pressure are increased, equilibrium is maintained by the same increase of boiling and condensation rates.  
FIGURE 13.29 Equilibrium between liquid and gas at two different boiling points inside a closed container. (a) The rates of boiling and condensation are equal at this combination of temperature and pressure, so the liquid and gas phases are in equilibrium. (b) At a higher temperature, the boiling rate is faster and the rates at which molecules leave the liquid and enter the gas are also faster. Because there are more molecules in the gas, the gas pressure is higher and the rate at which gas molecules condense and enter the liquid is faster. As a result the gas and liquid are in equilibrium at this higher temperature.

One example of equilibrium between liquid and gas is that of water and steam at  and 1.00 atm. This temperature is the boiling point at that pressure, so they should exist in equilibrium. Why does an open pot of water at  boil completely away? The gas surrounding an open pot is not pure water: it is mixed with air. If pure water and steam are in a closed container at  and 1.00 atm, they would coexist—but with air over the pot, there are fewer water molecules to condense, and water boils. What about water at  and 1.00 atm? This temperature and pressure correspond to the liquid region, yet an open glass of water at this temperature will completely evaporate. Again, the gas around it is air and not pure water vapor, so that the reduced evaporation rate is greater than the condensation rate of water from dry air. If the glass is sealed, then the liquid phase remains. We call the gas phase a vapor when it exists, as it does for water at  , at a temperature below the boiling temperature.

Explain why a cup of water (or soda) with ice cubes stays at  , even on a hot summer day.

# Solution

The ice and liquid water are in thermal equilibrium, so that the temperature stays at the freezing temperature as long as ice remains in the liquid. (Once all of the ice melts, the water temperature will start to rise.)# Vapor Pressure, Partial Pressure, and Dalton’s Law

Vapor pressure is defined as the pressure at which a gas coexists with its solid or liquid phase. Vapor pressure is created by faster molecules that break away from the liquid or solid and enter the gas phase. The vapor pressure of a substance depends on both the substance and its temperature—an increase in temperature increases the vapor pressure.

Partial pressure is defined as the pressure a gas would create if it occupied the total volume available. In a mixture of gases, the total pressure is the sum of partial pressures of the component gases, assuming ideal gas behavior and no chemical reactions between the components. This law is known as Dalton’s law of partial pressures, after the English scientist John Dalton (1766–1844), who proposed it. Dalton’s law is based on kinetic theory, where each gas creates its pressure by molecular collisions, independent of other gases present. It is consistent with the fact that pressures add according to Pascal’s Principle. Thus water evaporates and ice sublimates when their vapor pressures exceed the partial pressure of water vapor in the surrounding mixture of gases. If their vapor pressures are less than the partial pressure of water vapor in the surrounding gas, liquid droplets or ice crystals (frost) form.

# CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING

Is energy transfer involved in a phase change? If so, will energy have to be supplied to change phase from solid to liquid and liquid to gas? What about gas to liquid and liquid to solid? Why do they spray the orange trees with water in Florida when the temperatures are near or just below freezing?

# Solution

Yes, energy transfer is involved in a phase change. We know that atoms and molecules in solids and liquids are bound to each other because we know that force is required to separate them. So in a phase change from solid to liquid and liquid to gas, a force must be exerted, perhaps by collision, to separate atoms and molecules. Force exerted through a distance is work, and energy is needed to do work to go from solid to liquid and liquid to gas. This is intuitively consistent with the need for energy to melt ice or boil water. The converse is also true. Going from gas to liquid or liquid to solid involves atoms and molecules pushing together, doing work and releasing energy.

# 13.6 Humidity, Evaporation, and Boiling

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Explain the relationship between vapor pressure of water and the capacity of air to hold water vapor.   
Explain the relationship between relative humidity and partial pressure of water vapor in the air.   
Calculate vapor density using vapor pressure.   
Calculate humidity and dew point.  
FIGURE 13.30 Dew drops like these, on a banana leaf photographed just after sunrise, form when the air temperature drops to or below the dew point. At the dew point, the rate at which water molecules join together is greater than the rate at which they separate, and some of the water condenses to form droplets. (credit: Aaron Escobar, Flickr)

The expression “it’s not the heat, it’s the humidity” makes a valid point. We keep cool in hot weather by evaporating sweat from our skin and water from our breathing passages. Because evaporation is inhibited by high humidity, we feel hotter at a given temperature when the humidity is high. Low humidity, on the other hand, can cause discomfort from excessive drying of mucous membranes and can lead to an increased risk of respiratory infections.

When we say humidity, we really mean relative humidity. Relative humidity tells us how much water vapor is in the air compared with the maximum possible. At its maximum, denoted as saturation, the relative humidity is  , and evaporation is inhibited. The amount of water vapor in the air depends on temperature. For example, relative humidity rises in the evening, as air temperature declines, sometimes reaching the dew point. At the dew point temperature, relative humidity is  , and fog may result from the condensation of water droplets if they are small enough to stay in suspension. Conversely, if you wish to dry something (perhaps your hair), it is more effective to blow hot air over it rather than cold air, because, among other things, the increase in temperature increases the energy of the molecules, so the rate of evaporation increases.

The amount of water vapor in the air depends on the vapor pressure of water. The liquid and solid phases are continuously giving off vapor because some of the molecules have high enough speeds to enter the gas phase; see Figure 13.31(a). If a lid is placed over the container, as in Figure 13.31(b), evaporation continues, increasing the pressure, until sufficient vapor has built up for condensation to balance evaporation. Then equilibrium has been achieved, and the vapor pressure is equal to the partial pressure of water in the container. Vapor pressure increases with temperature because molecular speeds are higher as temperature increases. Table 13.5 gives representative values of water vapor pressure over a range of temperatures.

  
FIGURE 13.31 (a) Because of the distribution of speeds and kinetic energies, some water molecules can break away to the vapor phase even at temperatures below the ordinary boiling point. (b) If the container is sealed, evaporation will continue until there is enough vapor density for the condensation rate to equal the evaporation rate. This vapor density and the partial pressure it creates are the saturation values. They increase with temperature and are independent of the presence of other gases, such as air. They depend only on the vapor pressure of water.

Relative humidity is related to the partial pressure of water vapor in the air. At  humidity, the partial pressure isequal to the vapor pressure, and no more water can enter the vapor phase. If the partial pressure is less than the vapor pressure, then evaporation will take place, as humidity is less than  . If the partial pressure is greater than the vapor pressure, condensation takes place. In everyday language, people sometimes refer to the capacity of air to “hold” water vapor, but this is not actually what happens. The water vapor is not held by the air. The amount of water in air is determined by the vapor pressure of water and has nothing to do with the properties of air.

# EXAMPLE 13.12

# Calculating Density Using Vapor Pressure

Table 13.5 gives the vapor pressure of water at  as  Use the ideal gas law to calculate the density of water vapor in  that would create a partial pressure equal to this vapor pressure. Compare the result with the saturation vapor density given in the table.

# Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into a two steps. The partial pressure follows the ideal gas law,



where is the number of moles. If we solve this equation for  to calculate the number of moles per cubic meter, we can then convert this quantity to grams per cubic meter as requested. To do this, we need to use the molecular mass of water, which is given in the periodic table.

# Solution

1. Identify the knowns and convert them to the proper units:

a. temperature  b. vapor pressure  of water at  is  Pa c. molecular mass of water is 

2. Solve the ideal gas law for  .



3. Substitute known values into the equation and solve for  .



4. Convert the density in moles per cubic meter to grams per cubic meter.



# Discussion

The density is obtained by assuming a pressure equal to the vapor pressure of water at  . The density found is identical to the value in Table 13.5, which means that a vapor density of  at  creates a partial pressure of  equal to the vapor pressure of water at that temperature. If the partial pressure is equal to the vapor pressure, then the liquid and vapor phases are in equilibrium, and the relative humidity is  . Thus, there can be no more than  of water vapor per  at  , so that this value is the saturation vapor density at that temperature. This example illustrates how water vapor behaves like an ideal gas: the pressure and density are consistent with the ideal gas law (assuming the density in the table is correct). The saturation vapor densities listed in Table 13.5 are the maximum amounts of water vapor that air can hold at various temperatures.# Percent Relative Humidity

We define percent relative humidity as the ratio of vapor density to saturation vapor density, or



We can use this and the data in Table 13.5 to do a variety of interesting calculations, keeping in mind that relative humidity is based on the comparison of the partial pressure of water vapor in air and ice.

# EXAMPLE 13.13

(b) At what temperature will this air reach  relative humidity (the saturation density)? This temperature is the dew point. (c) What is the humidity when the air temperature is  and the dew point is 

# Strategy and Solution

(a) Percent relative humidity is defined as the ratio of vapor density to saturation vapor density.

The first is given to be  , and the second is found in Table 13.5 to be  . Thus,



(b) The air contains  of water vapor. The relative humidity will be  at a temperature where  is the saturation density. Inspection of Table 13.5 reveals this to be the case at  where the relative humidity will be  . That temperature is called the dew point for air with this concentration of water vapor.

(c) Here, the dew point temperature is given to be  . Using Table 13.5, we see that the vapor density is  , because this value is the saturation vapor density at  . The saturation vapor density at  is seen to be  . Thus, the relative humidity at  is



# Discussion

The importance of dew point is that air temperature cannot drop below  in part (b), or  in part (c), without water vapor condensing out of the air. If condensation occurs, considerable transfer of heat occurs (discussed in Heat and Heat Transfer Methods), which prevents the temperature from further dropping. When dew points are below  , freezing temperatures are a greater possibility, which explains why farmers keep track of the dew point. Low humidity in deserts means low dew-point temperatures. Thus condensation is unlikely. If the temperature drops, vapor does not condense in liquid drops. Because no heat is released into the air, the air temperature drops more rapidly compared to air with higher humidity. Likewise, at high temperatures, liquid droplets do not evaporate, so that no heat is removed from the gas to the liquid phase. This explains the large range of temperature in arid regions.

Why does water boil at  You will note from Table 13.5 that the vapor pressure of water at  is  , or 1.00 atm. Thus, it can evaporate without limit at this temperature and pressure. But why does itform bubbles when it boils? This is because water ordinarily contains significant amounts of dissolved air and other impurities, which are observed as small bubbles of air in a glass of water. If a bubble starts out at the bottom of the container at  , it contains water vapor (about  ). The pressure inside the bubble is fixed at 1.00 atm (we ignore the slight pressure exerted by the water around it). As the temperature rises, the amount of air in the bubble stays the same, but the water vapor increases; the bubble expands to keep the pressure at 1.00 atm. At  , water vapor enters the bubble continuously since the partial pressure of water is equal to 1.00 atm in equilibrium. It cannot reach this pressure, however, since the bubble also contains air and total pressure is 1.00 atm. The bubble grows in size and thereby increases the buoyant force. The bubble breaks away and rises rapidly to the surface—we call this boiling! (See Figure 13.32.)

  
FIGURE 13.32 (a) An air bubble in water starts out saturated with water vapor at  . (b) As the temperature rises, water vapor enters the bubble because its vapor pressure increases. The bubble expands to keep its pressure at 1.00 atm. (c) At  , water vapor enters the bubble continuously because water’s vapor pressure exceeds its partial pressure in the bubble, which must be less than 1.00 atm. The bubble grows and rises to the surface.

# CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING

Freeze drying is a process in which substances, such as foods, are dried by placing them in a vacuum chamber and lowering the atmospheric pressure around them. How does the lowered atmospheric pressure speed the drying process, and why does it cause the temperature of the food to drop?

# Solution

Decreased the atmospheric pressure results in decreased partial pressure of water, hence a lower humidity. So evaporation of water from food, for example, will be enhanced. The molecules of water most likely to break away from the food will be those with the greatest velocities. Those remaining thus have a lower average velocity and a lower temperature. This can (and does) result in the freezing and drying of the food; hence the process is aptly named freeze drying.

# Section Summary

# 13.1 Temperature

• Temperature is the quantity measured by a thermometer.   
• Temperature is related to the average kinetic energy of atoms and molecules in a system.   
• Absolute zero is the temperature at which there is no molecular motion.   
• There are three main temperature scales: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.   
Temperatures on one scale can be converted to temperatures on another scale using the following equations:    
Systems are in thermal equilibrium when they have the same temperature.   
Thermal equilibrium occurs when two bodies are in contact with each other and can freely exchange energy.   
The zeroth law of thermodynamics states that when two systems, A and B, are in thermal   
equilibrium with each other, and B is in thermal equilibrium with a third system, C, then A is also in thermal equilibrium with C.

# 13.2 Thermal Expansion of Solids and Liquids

• Thermal expansion is the increase, or decrease, of the size (length, area, or volume) of a body due to a change in temperature.   
Thermal expansion is large for gases, and relatively small, but not negligible, for liquids and solids. Linear thermal expansion is  , where  is the change in length  ,  is the change in temperature, and  is the coefficient of linear expansion, which varies slightly with temperature.   
The change in area due to thermal expansion is  , where  is the change in area. The change in volume due to thermal expansion is  , where  is the coefficient of volume expansion and  . Thermal stress is created when thermal expansion is constrained.

# 13.3 The Ideal Gas Law

• The ideal gas law relates the pressure and volume of a gas to the number of gas molecules and the temperature of the gas. The ideal gas law can be written in terms of the number of molecules of gas:  . where  is pressure,  is volume,  is temperature,  is number of molecules, and  is the Boltzmann constant  K.   
• A mole is the number of atoms in a 12-g sample of carbon-12.   
• The number of molecules in a mole is called Avogadro’s number  ,    
• A mole of any substance has a mass in grams equal to its molecular weight, which can be determined from the periodic table of elements.   
The ideal gas law can also be written and solved in terms of the number of moles of gas:  where  is number of moles and  is the universal gas constant,    
The ideal gas law is generally valid at temperatures well above the boiling temperature.

# 13.4 Kinetic Theory: Atomic and Molecular Explanation of Pressure and Temperature

Kinetic theory is the atomistic description of gases as well as liquids and solids.   
Kinetic theory models the properties of matter in terms of continuous random motion of atoms and molecules.   
The ideal gas law can also be expressed as   
   
where  is the pressure (average force per unit area),  is the volume of gas in the container,  is the number of molecules in the container,  is the mass of a molecule, and  is the average of the molecular speed squared.   
Thermal energy is defined to be the average   
translational kinetic energy  of an atom or   
molecule.   
The temperature of gases is proportional to the average translational kinetic energy of atoms and molecules.   
   
or   
   
The motion of individual molecules in a gas is random in magnitude and direction. However, a gas of many molecules has a predictable   
distribution of molecular speeds, known as the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.

# 13.5 Phase Changes

• Most substances have three distinct phases: gas, liquid, and solid. Phase changes among the various phases of matter depend on temperature and pressure. The existence of the three phases with respect to pressure and temperature can be described in a phase diagram.Two phases coexist (i.e., they are in thermal equilibrium) at a set of pressures and temperatures. These are described as a line on a phase diagram. The three phases coexist at a single pressure and temperature. This is known as the triple point and is described by a single point on a phase diagram. A gas at a temperature below its boiling point is called a vapor.   
• Vapor pressure is the pressure at which a gas coexists with its solid or liquid phase. Partial pressure is the pressure a gas would create if it existed alone.   
• Dalton’s law states that the total pressure is the

sum of the partial pressures of all of the gases present.

# 13.6 Humidity, Evaporation, and Boiling

• Relative humidity is the fraction of water vapor in a gas compared to the saturation value. The saturation vapor density can be determined from the vapor pressure for a given temperature. Percent relative humidity is defined to be percent relative humidity  vapor density .  saturation vapor density   
• The dew point is the temperature at which air reaches  relative humidity.
