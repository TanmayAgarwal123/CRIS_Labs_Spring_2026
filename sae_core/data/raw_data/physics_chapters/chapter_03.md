Tennis players must account for the arc of the ball and the impact of its spin, while they also predict how it will bounce and plan the location of their shot. Motion along a curved path is two- or three-dimensional motion, and can be described in a similar fashion to one-dimensional motion. (credit: Edwin Martinez/Flickr)

INTRODUCTION TO TWO-DIMENSIONAL KINEMATICS The arc of a basketball, the orbit of a satellite, a bicycle rounding a curve, a swimmer diving into a pool, blood gushing out of a wound, and a puppy chasing its tail are but a few examples of motions along curved paths. In fact, most motions in nature follow curved paths rather than straight lines. Motion along a curved path on a flat surface or a plane (such as that of a ball on a pool table or a skater on an ice rink) is two-dimensional, and thus described by two-dimensional kinematics. Motion not confined to a plane, such as a car following a winding mountain road, is described by three-dimensional kinematics. Both two- and three-dimensional kinematics are simple extensions of the one-dimensional kinematics developed for straight-line motion in the previous chapter. This simple extension will allow us to apply physics to many more situations, and it will also yield unexpected insights about nature.

# Two-Dimensional Motion: Walking in a City

Suppose you want to walk from one point to another in a city with uniform square blocks, as pictured in Figure 3.3.

  
FIGURE 3.3 A pedestrian walks a two-dimensional path between two points in a city. In this scene, all blocks are square and are the same size.

The straight-line path that a helicopter might fly is blocked to you as a pedestrian, and so you are forced to take a two-dimensional path, such as the one shown. You walk 14 blocks in all, 9 east followed by 5 north. What is the straight-line distance?

An old adage states that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. The two legs of the trip and the straight-line path form a right triangle, and so the Pythagorean theorem,  , can be used to find the straight-line distance.

  
FIGURE 3.4 The Pythagorean theorem relates the length of the legs of a right triangle, labeled  and  , with the hypotenuse, labeled . The relationship is given by:  . This can be rewritten, solving for  .The hypotenuse of the triangle is the straight-line path, and so in this case its length in units of city blocks is  , considerably shorter than the 14 blocks you walked. (Note that we are using three significant figures in the answer. Although it appears that “9” and “5” have only one significant digit, they are discrete numbers. In this case  blocks” is the same as  or 9.00 blocks.” We have decided to use three significant figures in the answer in order to show the result more precisely.)

  
FIGURE 3.5 The straight-line path followed by a helicopter between the two points is shorter than the 14 blocks walked by the pedestrian. All blocks are square and the same size.

The fact that the straight-line distance (10.3 blocks) in Figure 3.5 is less than the total distance walked (14 blocks) is one example of a general characteristic of vectors. (Recall that vectors are quantities that have both magnitude and direction.)

As for one-dimensional kinematics, we use arrows to represent vectors. The length of the arrow is proportional to the vector’s magnitude. The arrow’s length is indicated by hash marks in Figure 3.3 and Figure 3.5. The arrow points in the same direction as the vector. For two-dimensional motion, the path of an object can be represented with three vectors: one vector shows the straight-line path between the initial and final points of the motion, one vector shows the horizontal component of the motion, and one vector shows the vertical component of the motion. The horizontal and vertical components of the motion add together to give the straight-line path. For example, observe the three vectors in Figure 3.5. The first represents a 9-block displacement east. The second represents a 5-block displacement north. These vectors are added to give the third vector, with a 10.3-block total displacement. The third vector is the straight-line path between the two points. Note that in this example, the vectors that we are adding are perpendicular to each other and thus form a right triangle. This means that we can use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the magnitude of the total displacement. (Note that we cannot use the Pythagorean theorem to add vectors that are not perpendicular. We will develop techniques for adding vectors having any direction, not just those perpendicular to one another, in Vector Addition and Subtraction: Graphical Methods and Vector Addition and Subtraction: Analytical Methods.)

# The Independence of Perpendicular Motions

The person taking the path shown in Figure 3.5 walks east and then north (two perpendicular directions). How far they walk east is only affected by their motion eastward. Similarly, how far they walk north is only affected by their motion northward.

# Independence of Motion

The horizontal and vertical components of two-dimensional motion are independent of each other. Any motion in the horizontal direction does not affect motion in the vertical direction, and vice versa.

This is true in a simple scenario like that of walking in one direction first, followed by another. It is also true of more complicated motion involving movement in two directions at once. For example, let’s compare the motions of two baseballs. One baseball is dropped from rest. At the same instant, another is thrown horizontally from the same height and follows a curved path. A stroboscope has captured the positions of the balls at fixed time intervals as they fall.  
FIGURE 3.6 This shows the motions of two identical balls—one falls from rest, the other has an initial horizontal velocity. Each subsequent position is an equal time interval. Arrows represent horizontal and vertical velocities at each position. The ball on the right has an initial horizontal velocity, while the ball on the left has no horizontal velocity. Despite the difference in horizontal velocities, the vertical velocities and positions are identical for both balls. This shows that the vertical and horizontal motions are independent.

It is remarkable that for each flash of the strobe, the vertical positions of the two balls are the same. This similarity implies that the vertical motion is independent of whether or not the ball is moving horizontally. (Assuming no air resistance, the vertical motion of a falling object is influenced by gravity only, and not by any horizontal forces.) Careful examination of the ball thrown horizontally shows that it travels the same horizontal distance between flashes. This is due to the fact that there are no additional forces on the ball in the horizontal direction after it is thrown. This result means that the horizontal velocity is constant, and affected neither by vertical motion nor by gravity (which is vertical). Note that this case is true only for ideal conditions. In the real world, air resistance will affect the speed of the balls in both directions.

The two-dimensional curved path of the horizontally thrown ball is composed of two independent one-dimensional motions (horizontal and vertical). The key to analyzing such motion, called projectile motion, is to resolve (break) it into motions along perpendicular directions. Resolving two-dimensional motion into perpendicular components is possible because the components are independent. We shall see how to resolve vectors in Vector Addition and Subtraction: Graphical Methods and Vector Addition and Subtraction: Analytical Methods. We will find such techniques to be useful in many areas of physics.

# 3.2 Vector Addition and Subtraction: Graphical Methods

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Understand the rules of vector addition, subtraction, and multiplication.   
Apply graphical methods of vector addition and subtraction to determine the displacement of moving objects.  
FIGURE 3.7 Displacement can be determined graphically using a scale map, such as this one of the Hawaiian Islands. A journey from Hawai’i to Moloka’i has a number of legs, or journey segments. These segments can be added graphically with a ruler to determine the total two-dimensional displacement of the journey. (credit: US Geological Survey)

# Vectors in Two Dimensions

A vector is a quantity that has magnitude and direction. Displacement, velocity, acceleration, and force, for example, are all vectors. In one-dimensional, or straight-line, motion, the direction of a vector can be given simply by a plus or minus sign. In two dimensions (2-d), however, we specify the direction of a vector relative to some reference frame (i.e., coordinate system), using an arrow having length proportional to the vector’s magnitude and pointing in the direction of the vector.

Figure 3.8 shows such a graphical representation of a vector, using as an example the total displacement for the person walking in a city considered in Kinematics in Two Dimensions: An Introduction. We shall use the notation that a boldface symbol, such as , stands for a vector. Its magnitude is represented by the symbol in italics,  , and its direction by  .

# Vectors in this Text

In this text, we will represent a vector with a boldface variable. For example, we will represent the quantity force with the vector  , which has both magnitude and direction. The magnitude of the vector will be represented by a variable in italics, such as  , and the direction of the variable will be given by an angle  .

  
FIGURE 3.8 A person walks 9 blocks east and 5 blocks north. The displacement is 10.3 blocks at an angle  north of east.  
FIGURE 3.9 To describe the resultant vector for the person walking in a city considered in Figure 3.8 graphically, draw an arrow to represent the total displacement vector . Using a protractor, draw a line at an angle  relative to the east-west axis. The length  of the arrow is proportional to the vector’s magnitude and is measured along the line with a ruler. In this example, the magnitude  of the vector is 10.3 units, and the direction  is  north of east.

# Vector Addition: Head-to-Tail Method

The head-to-tail method is a graphical way to add vectors, described in Figure 3.10 below and in the steps following. The tail of the vector is the starting point of the vector, and the head (or tip) of a vector is the final, pointed end of the arrow.

  
FIGURE 3.10 Head-to-Tail Method: The head-to-tail method of graphically adding vectors is illustrated for the two displacements of the person walking in a city considered in Figure 3.8. (a) Draw a vector representing the displacement to the east. (b) Draw a vector representing the displacement to the north. The tail of this vector should originate from the head of the first, east-pointing vector. (c) Draw a line from the tail of the east-pointing vector to the head of the north-pointing vector to form the sum or resultant vector . The length of the arrow  is proportional to the vector’s magnitude and is measured to be 10.3 units . Its direction, described as the angle with respect to the east (or horizontal axis)  is measured with a protractor to be .

Step 1. Draw an arrow to represent the first vector (9 blocks to the east) using a ruler and protractor.

The graphical addition of vectors is limited in accuracy only by the precision with which the drawings can be made and the precision of the measuring tools. It is valid for any number of vectors.

# EXAMPLE 3.1

# Adding Vectors Graphically Using the Head-to-Tail Method: A Woman Takes a Walk

Use the graphical technique for adding vectors to find the total displacement of a person who walks the following three paths (displacements) on a flat field. First, she walks  in a direction  north of east. Then, she walks  heading  north of east. Finally, she turns and walks  in a direction  south of east.

# Strategy

Represent each displacement vector graphically with an arrow, labeling the first , the second , and the third , making the lengths proportional to the distance and the directions as specified relative to an east-west line. The head-to-tail method outlined above will give a way to determine the magnitude and direction of the resultant displacement, denoted .

# Solution

(1) Draw the three displacement vectors.

  
FIGURE 3.14

(2) Place the vectors head to tail retaining both their initial magnitude and direction.

  
FIGURE 3.15

(3) Draw the resultant vector, .  
FIGURE 3.16

(4) Use a ruler to measure the magnitude of , and a protractor to measure the direction of . While the direction of the vector can be specified in many ways, the easiest way is to measure the angle between the vector and the nearest horizontal or vertical axis. Since the resultant vector is south of the eastward pointing axis, we flip the protractor upside down and measure the angle between the eastward axis and the vector.

  
FIGURE 3.17

In this case, the total displacement is seen to have a magnitude of  and to lie in a direction  south of east. By using its magnitude and direction, this vector can be expressed as  and  south of east.

# Discussion

The head-to-tail graphical method of vector addition works for any number of vectors. It is also important to note that the resultant is independent of the order in which the vectors are added. Therefore, we could add the vectors in any order as illustrated in Figure 3.18 and we will still get the same solution.

  
FIGURE 3.18

Here, we see that when the same vectors are added in a different order, the result is the same. This characteristic is true in every case and is an important characteristic of vectors. Vector addition is commutative. Vectors can beadded in any order.



(This is true for the addition of ordinary numbers as well—you get the same result whether you add  or  , for example).

# Vector Subtraction

Vector subtraction is a straightforward extension of vector addition. To define subtraction (say we want to subtract from , written , we must first define what we mean by subtraction. The negative of a vector is defined to be ; that is, graphically the negative of any vector has the same magnitude but the opposite direction, as shown in Figure 3.19. In other words, has the same length as , but points in the opposite direction. Essentially, we just flip the vector so it points in the opposite direction.



FIGURE 3.19 The negative of a vector is just another vector of the same magnitude but pointing in the opposite direction. So is the negative of ; it has the same length but opposite direction.

The subtraction of vector  from vector  is then simply defined to be the addition of  to . Note that vector subtraction is the addition of a negative vector. The order of subtraction does not affect the results.



This is analogous to the subtraction of scalars (where, for example,  . Again, the result is independent of the order in which the subtraction is made. When vectors are subtracted graphically, the techniques outlined above are used, as the following example illustrates.

# EXAMPLE 3.2

# Subtracting Vectors Graphically: A Woman Sailing a Boat

A woman sailing a boat at night is following directions to a dock. The instructions read to first sail  in a direction  north of east from her current location, and then travel  in a direction  north of east (or  west of north). If the woman makes a mistake and travels in the opposite direction for the second leg of the trip, where will she end up? Compare this location with the location of the dock.  
FIGURE 3.20

# Strategy

We can represent the first leg of the trip with a vector , and the second leg of the trip with a vector . The dock is located at a location  . If the woman mistakenly travels in the opposite direction for the second leg of the journey, she will travel a distance  in the direction  south of east. We represent this as , as shown below. The vector  has the same magnitude as but is in the opposite direction. Thus, she will end up at a location  , or .

  
FIGURE 3.21

We will perform vector addition to compare the location of the dock,  , with the location at which the woman mistakenly arrives,  .

# Solution

(1) To determine the location at which the woman arrives by accident, draw vectors and .

(2) Place the vectors head to tail.

(3) Draw the resultant vector .

(4) Use a ruler and protractor to measure the magnitude and direction of .

  
FIGURE 3.22

In this case,  and  south of east.(5) To determine the location of the dock, we repeat this method to add vectors and . We obtain the resultant vector :

  
FIGURE 3.23

In this case  and  north of east.

We can see that the woman will end up a significant distance from the dock if she travels in the opposite direction for the second leg of the trip.

# Discussion

Because subtraction of a vector is the same as addition of a vector with the opposite direction, the graphical method of subtracting vectors works the same as for addition.

# Multiplication of Vectors and Scalars

If we decided to walk three times as far on the first leg of the trip considered in the preceding example, then we would walk  , or  , in a direction  north of east. This is an example of multiplying a vector by a positive scalar. Notice that the magnitude changes, but the direction stays the same.

If the scalar is negative, then multiplying a vector by it changes the vector’s magnitude and gives the new vector the opposite direction. For example, if you multiply by  , the magnitude doubles but the direction changes. We can summarize these rules in the following way: When vector is multiplied by a scalar  ,

• the magnitude of the vector becomes the absolute value of  , • if  is positive, the direction of the vector does not change, • if  is negative, the direction is reversed.

In our case,  and  . Vectors are multiplied by scalars in many situations. Note that division is the inverse of multiplication. For example, dividing by 2 is the same as multiplying by the value (1/2). The rules for multiplication of vectors by scalars are the same for division; simply treat the divisor as a scalar between 0 and 1.

# Resolving a Vector into Components

In the examples above, we have been adding vectors to determine the resultant vector. In many cases, however, we will need to do the opposite. We will need to take a single vector and find what other vectors added together produce it. In most cases, this involves determining the perpendicular components of a single vector, for example the  and y-components, or the north-south and east-west components.

For example, we may know that the total displacement of a person walking in a city is 10.3 blocks in a direction  north of east and want to find out how many blocks east and north had to be walked. This method is called process followed to find the total displacement. It is one example of finding the components of a vector. There are many applications in physics where this is a useful thing to do. We will see this soon in Projectile Motion, and much more when we cover forces in Dynamics: Newton’s Laws of Motion. Most of these involve finding components alongperpendicular axes (such as north and east), so that right triangles are involved. The analytical techniques presented in Vector Addition and Subtraction: Analytical Methods are ideal for finding vector components.

# 3.3 Vector Addition and Subtraction: Analytical Methods

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Understand the rules of vector addition and subtraction using analytical methods.   
Apply analytical methods to determine vertical and horizontal component vectors.   
Apply analytical methods to determine the magnitude and direction of a resultant vector.

Analytical methods of vector addition and subtraction employ geometry and simple trigonometry rather than the ruler and protractor of graphical methods. Part of the graphical technique is retained, because vectors are still represented by arrows for easy visualization. However, analytical methods are more concise, accurate, and precise than graphical methods, which are limited by the accuracy with which a drawing can be made. Analytical methods are limited only by the accuracy and precision with which physical quantities are known.

# Resolving a Vector into Perpendicular Components

Analytical techniques and right triangles go hand-in-hand in physics because (among other things) motions along perpendicular directions are independent. We very often need to separate a vector into perpendicular components. For example, given a vector like in Figure 3.24, we may wish to find which two perpendicular vectors,  and  , add to produce it.

  
FIGURE 3.24 The vector , with its tail at the origin of an  ,  -coordinate system, is shown together with its  and  components,  and  . These vectors form a right triangle. The analytical relationships among these vectors are summarized below.

 and  are defined to be the components of  along the  and  -axes. The three vectors ,  , and  form a right triangle:



Note that this relationship between vector components and the resultant vector holds only for vector quantities (which include both magnitude and direction). The relationship does not apply for the magnitudes alone. For example, if  east,  north, and  north-east, then it is true that the vectors  . However, it is not true that the sum of the magnitudes of the vectors is also equal. That is,

Thus,



If the vector is known, then its magnitude  (its length) and its angle  (its direction) are known. To find  and  , its  and  -components, we use the following relationships for a right triangle.



and

Suppose, for example, that  is the vector representing the total displacement of the person walking in a city considered in Kinematics in Two Dimensions: An Introduction and Vector Addition and Subtraction: Graphical Methods.

  
FIGURE 3.26 We can use the relationships  cos  and  sin  to determine the magnitude of the horizontal and vertical component vectors in this example.

Then  blocks and  , so that





# Calculating a Resultant Vector

If the perpendicular components  and  of a vector are known, then can also be found analytically. To findthe magnitude  and direction  of a vector from its perpendicular components  and  , relative to the  -axis, we use the following relationships:



  
FIGURE 3.27 The magnitude and direction of the resultant vector can be determined once the horizontal and vertical components  and  have been determined.

Note that the equation  is just the Pythagorean theorem relating the legs of a right triangle to the length of the hypotenuse. For example, if  and  are 9 and 5 blocks, respectively, then  blocks, again consistent with the example of the person walking in a city. Finally, the direction is  , as before.

# Determining Vectors and Vector Components with Analytical Methods

Equations  cos  and  sin  are used to find the perpendicular components of a vector—that is, to go from  and  to  and  . Equations  and  are used to find a vector from its perpendicular components—that is, to go from  and  to  and  . Both processes are crucial to analytical methods of vector addition and subtraction.

# Adding Vectors Using Analytical Methods

To see how to add vectors using perpendicular components, consider Figure 3.28, in which the vectors and are added to produce the resultant .

  
FIGURE 3.28 Vectors and are two legs of a walk, and is the resultant or total displacement. You can use analytical methods to determine the magnitude and direction of  .

If and represent two legs of a walk (two displacements), then  is the total displacement. The person taking the walk ends up at the tip of There are many ways to arrive at the same point. In particular, the person couldhave walked first in the  -direction and then in the  -direction. Those paths are the  and y-components of the resultant,  and  . If we know  and  , we can find  and  using the equations  and  . When you use the analytical method of vector addition, you can determine the components or the magnitude and direction of a vector.

Step 1. Identify the  and y-axes that will be used in the problem. Then, find the components of each vector to be added along the chosen perpendicular axes. Use the equations  cos  and  sin  to find the components. In Figure 3.29, these components are  ,  , and  . The angles that vectors and  make with the  -axis are  and  , respectively.

  
FIGURE 3.29 To add vectors and , first determine the horizontal and vertical components of each vector. These are the dotted vectors  ,  ,  and  shown in the image.

SFhpe ulanhptv along that axis. That is, as shown in Figure 3.30,



and



  
FIGURE 3.30 The magnitude of the vectors  and  add to give the magnitude  of the resultant vector in the horizontal direction. Similarly, the magnitudes of the vectors  and  add to give the magnitude  of the resultant vector in the vertical direction.

Components along the same axis, say the  -axis, are vectors along the same line and, thus, can be added to one another like ordinary numbers. The same is true for components along the  -axis. (For example, a 9-block eastward walk could be taken in two legs, the first 3 blocks east and the second 6 blocks east, for a total of 9, because they are along the same direction.) So resolving vectors into components along common axes makes it easier to add them. Now that the components of are known, its magnitude and direction can be found.

Step 3. To get the magnitude R of the resultant, use the Pythagorean theorem:

Step 4. To get the direction of the resultant relative to the  -axis:



The following example illustrates this technique for adding vectors using perpendicular components.

# EXAMPLE 3.3

# Adding Vectors Using Analytical Methods

Add the vector to the vector shown in Figure 3.31, using perpendicular components along the  and y-axes. The  and  -axes are along the east–west and north–south directions, respectively. Vector represents the first leg of a walk in which a person walks  in a direction  north of east. Vector represents the second leg, a displacement of  in a direction  north of east.

  
FIGURE 3.31 Vector has magnitude  and direction  north of the  -axis. Vector  has magnitude  and direction north of the  -axis. You can use analytical methods to determine the magnitude and direction of  .

# Strategy

The components of and  along the  and y-axes represent walking due east and due north to get to the same ending point. Once found, they are combined to produce the resultant.

# Solution

Following the method outlined above, we first find the components of  and  along the  and y-axes. Note that  ,  ,  , and  . We find the  -components by using  cos  , which gives



and



Similarly, the y-components are found using  :



and

The  and y-components of the resultant are thus



and



Now we can find the magnitude of the resultant by using the Pythagorean theorem:



so that



Finally, we find the direction of the resultant:



Thus,



  
FIGURE 3.32 Using analytical methods, we see that the magnitude of  is  and its direction is  north of east.

# Discussion

This example illustrates the addition of vectors using perpendicular components. Vector subtraction using perpendicular components is very similar—it is just the addition of a negative vector.

Subtraction of vectors is accomplished by the addition of a negative vector. That is,  . Thus, the method for the subtraction of vectors using perpendicularcomponents is identical tothat foraddition. The components of are the negatives of the components of . The  and  -components of the resultant  are thus



and



and the rest of the method outlined above is identical to that for addition. (See Figure 3.33.)

Analyzing vectors using perpendicular components is very useful in many areas of physics, because perpendicular quantities are often independent of one another. The next module, Projectile Motion, is one of many in which using perpendicular components helps make the picture clear and simplifies the physics.

# 3.4 Projectile Motion

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Identify and explain the properties of a projectile, such as acceleration due to gravity, range, maximum height, and trajectory. Determine the location and velocity of a projectile at different points in its trajectory. • Apply the principle of independence of motion to solve projectile motion problems.

Projectile motion is the motion of an object thrown or projected into the air, subject to only the acceleration of gravity. The object is called a projectile, and its path is called its trajectory. The motion of falling objects, as covered in Problem-Solving Basics for One-Dimensional Kinematics, is a simple one-dimensional type of projectile motion in which there is no horizontal movement. In this section, we consider two-dimensional projectile motion, such as that of a football or other object for which air resistance is negligible.

The most important fact to remember here is that motions along perpendicular axes are independent and thus can be analyzed separately. This fact was discussed in Kinematics in Two Dimensions: An Introduction, where vertical and horizontal motions were seen to be independent. The key to analyzing two-dimensional projectile motion is to break it into two motions, one along the horizontal axis and the other along the vertical. (This choice of axes is the most sensible, because acceleration due to gravity is vertical—thus, there will be no acceleration along the horizontal axis when air resistance is negligible.) As is customary, we call the horizontal axis the  axis and the vertical axis the y-axis. Figure 3.34 illustrates the notation for displacement, where is defined to be the total displacement and  and are its components along the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively. The magnitudes of these vectors are s,  and  (Note that in the last section we used the notation to represent a vector with components  and  . If we continued this format, we would call displacement with components  and  . However, to simplify the notation, we will simply represent the component vectors as and .)

Of course, to describe motion we must deal with velocity and acceleration, as well as with displacement. We must find their components along the  and y-axes, too. We will assume all forces except gravity (such as air resistance and friction, for example) are negligible. The components of acceleration are then very simple:  . (Note that this definition assumes that the upwards direction is defined as the positivedirection. If you arrange the coordinate system instead such that the downwards direction is positive, then acceleration due to gravity takes a positive value.) Because gravity is vertical,  . Both accelerations are constant, so the kinematic equations can be used.

# EXAMPLE 3.4

# A Fireworks Projectile Explodes High and Away

During a fireworks display, a shell is shot into the air with an initial speed of  at an angle of  above the horizontal, as illustrated in Figure 3.36. The fuse is timed to ignite the shell just as it reaches its highest point above the ground. (a) Calculate the height at which the shell explodes. (b) How much time passed between the launch of the shell and the explosion? (c) What is the horizontal displacement of the shell when it explodes?

# Strategy

Because air resistance is negligible for the unexploded shell, the analysis method outlined above can be used. The motion can be broken into horizontal and vertical motions in which  and  . We can then define  and  to be zero and solve for the desired quantities.# Solution for (a)

By “height” we mean the altitude or vertical position  above the starting point. The highest point in any trajectory, called the apex, is reached when  . Since we know the initial and final velocities as well as the initial position, we use the following equation to find  :



  
FIGURE 3.36 The trajectory of a fireworks shell. The fuse is set to explode the shell at the highest point in its trajectory, which is found to be at a height of  and  away horizontally.

Because  and  are both zero, the equation simplifies to



Solving for  gives



Now we must find  , the component of the initial velocity in the  -direction. It is given by  sin  , where  is the initial velocity of  , and  is the initial angle. Thus,



and  is



so that



# Discussion for (a)

Note that because up is positive, the initial velocity is positive, as is the maximum height, but the acceleration due to gravity is negative. Note also that the maximum height depends only on the vertical component of the initial velocity, so that any projectile with a  initial vertical component of velocity will reach a maximum height of  (neglecting air resistance). The numbers in this example are reasonable for large fireworks displays, the shells of which do reach such heights before exploding. In practice, air resistance is not completely negligible, and so the initial velocity would have to be somewhat larger than that given to reach the same height.# Solution for (b)

As in many physics problems, there is more than one way to solve for the time to the highest point. In this case, the easiest method is to use  . Because  is zero, this equation reduces to simply



Note that the final vertical velocity,  , at the highest point is zero. Thus,



# Discussion for (b)

This time is also reasonable for large fireworks. When you are able to see the launch of fireworks, you will notice several seconds pass before the shell explodes. (Another way of finding the time is by using  , and solving the quadratic equation for  .)

# Solution for (c)

Because air resistance is negligible,  and the horizontal velocity is constant, as discussed above. The horizontal displacement is horizontal velocity multiplied by time as given by  , where  is equal to zero:



where  is the  -component of the velocity, which is given by  cos  Now,



The time  for both motions is the same, and so  is



# Discussion for (c)

The horizontal motion is a constant velocity in the absence of air resistance. The horizontal displacement found here could be useful in keeping the fireworks fragments from falling on spectators. Once the shell explodes, air resistance has a major effect, and many fragments will land directly below.

In solving part (a) of the preceding example, the expression we found for  is valid for any projectile motion where air resistance is negligible. Call the maximum height  ; then,



This equation defines the maximum height of a projectile and depends only on the vertical component of the initial velocity.

# Defining a Coordinate System

It is important to set up a coordinate system when analyzing projectile motion. One part of defining the coordinate system is to define an origin for the  and  positions. Often, it is convenient to choose the initial position of the object as the origin such that  and  . It is also important to define the positive and negative directions in the  and  directions. Typically, we define the positive vertical direction as upwards, and the positive horizontal direction is usually the direction of the object’s motion. When this is the case, the vertical acceleration,  , takes a negative value (since it is directed downwards towards the Earth). However, it is occasionally useful to define the coordinates differently. For example, if you are analyzing the motion of a ballthrown downwards from the top of a cliff, it may make sense to define the positive direction downwards since the motion of the ball is solely in the downwards direction. If this is the case,  takes a positive value.

# EXAMPLE 3.5

# Calculating Projectile Motion: Hot Rock Projectile

Kilauea in Hawaii is the world’s most continuously active volcano. Very active volcanoes characteristically eject redhot rocks and lava rather than smoke and ash. Suppose a large rock is ejected from the volcano with a speed of 25.0  and at an angle  above the horizontal, as shown in Figure 3.37. The rock strikes the side of the volcano at an altitude  lower than its starting point. (a) Calculate the time it takes the rock to follow this path. (b) What are the magnitude and direction of the rock’s velocity at impact?

  
FIGURE 3.37 The trajectory of a rock ejected from the Kilauea volcano.

# Strategy

Again, resolving this two-dimensional motion into two independent one-dimensional motions will allow us to solve for the desired quantities. The time a projectile is in the air is governed by its vertical motion alone. We will solve for first. While the rock is rising and falling vertically, the horizontal motion continues at a constant velocity. This example asks for the final velocity. Thus, the vertical and horizontal results will be recombined to obtain  and  at the final time determined in the first part of the example.

# Solution for (a)

While the rock is in the air, it rises and then falls to a final position  lower than its starting altitude. We can find the time for this by using



If we take the initial position  to be zero, then the final position is  Now the initial vertical velocity is the vertical component of the initial velocity, found from  sin  . Substituting known values yields



Rearranging terms gives a quadratic equation in  :



This expression is a quadratic equation of the form  , where the constants are  , and  Its solutions are given by the quadratic formula:



This equation yields two solutions:  and  . (It is left as an exercise for the reader to verify thesesolutions.) The time is  or . The negative value of time implies an event before the start of motion, and so we discard it. Thus,



# Discussion for (a)

The time for projectile motion is completely determined by the vertical motion. So any projectile that has an initial vertical velocity of  and lands  below its starting altitude will spend 3.96 s in the air.

# Solution for (b)

From the information now in hand, we can find the final horizontal and vertical velocities  and  and combine them to find the total velocity  and the angle  it makes with the horizontal. Of course,  is constant so we can solve for it at any horizontal location. In this case, we chose the starting point since we know both the initial velocity and initial angle. Therefore:



The final vertical velocity is given by the following equation:



where  was found in part (a) to be  . Thus,



so that



To find the magnitude of the final velocity  we combine its perpendicular components, using the following equation:



which gives



The direction  is found from the equation:



so that



Thus,



# Discussion for (b)

The negative angle means that the velocity is  below the horizontal. This result is consistent with the fact that the final vertical velocity is negative and hence downward—as you would expect because the final altitude is  lower than the initial altitude. (See Figure 3.37.)

One of the most important things illustrated by projectile motion is that vertical and horizontal motions are independent of each other. Galileo was the first person to fully comprehend this characteristic. He used it to predict the range of a projectile. On level ground, we define range to be the horizontal distance  traveled by a projectile. Galileo and many others were interested in the range of projectiles primarily for military purposes—such as aiming cannons. However, investigating the range of projectiles can shed light on other interesting phenomena, such as the orbits of satellites around the Earth. Let us consider projectile range further.  
FIGURE 3.38 Trajectories of projectiles on level ground. (a) The greater the initial speed  , the greater the range for a given initial angle. (b) The effect of initial angle  on the range of a projectile with a given initial speed. Note that the range is the same for  and  , although the maximum heights of those paths are different.

How does the initial velocity of a projectile affect its range? Obviously, the greater the initial speed  , the greater the range, as shown in Figure 3.38(a). The initial angle  also has a dramatic effect on the range, as illustrated in Figure 3.38(b). For a fixed initial speed, such as might be produced by a cannon, the maximum range is obtained with  . This is true only for conditions neglecting air resistance. If air resistance is considered, the maximum angle is approximately  . Interestingly, for every initial angle except  , there are two angles that give the same range—the sum of those angles is  . The range also depends on the value of the acceleration of gravity  . The lunar astronaut Alan Shepherd was able to drive a golf ball a great distance on the Moon because gravity is weaker there. The range  of a projectile on level ground for which air resistance is negligible is given by



where  is the initial speed and  is the initial angle relative to the horizontal. The proof of this equation is left as an end-of-chapter problem (hints are given), but it does fit the major features of projectile range as described.

When we speak of the range of a projectile on level ground, we assume that  is very small compared with the circumference of the Earth. If, however, the range is large, the Earth curves away below the projectile and acceleration of gravity changes direction along the path. The range is larger than predicted by the range equation given above because the projectile has farther to fall than it would on level ground. (See Figure 3.39.) If the initial speed is great enough, the projectile goes into orbit. This possibility was recognized centuries before it could be accomplished. When an object is in orbit, the Earth curves away from underneath the object at the same rate as it falls. The object thus falls continuously but never hits the surface. These and other aspects of orbital motion, such as the rotation of the Earth, will be covered analytically and in greater depth later in this text.

Once again we see that thinking about one topic, such as the range of a projectile, can lead us to others, such as the Earth orbits. In Addition of Velocities, we will examine the addition of velocities, which is another important aspect of two-dimensional kinematics and will also yield insights beyond the immediate topic.  
FIGURE 3.39 Hypothetical projectile to satellite. From this theoretical tower, a projectile is launched from a very high tower to avoid air resistance. With increasing initial speed, the range increases and becomes longer than it would be on level ground because the Earth curves away underneath its path. With a large enough initial speed, orbit is achieved.

# 3.5 Addition of Velocities

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Apply principles of vector addition to determine relative velocity.   
Explain the significance of the observer in the measurement of velocity.

# Relative Velocity

If a person rows a boat across a rapidly flowing river and tries to head directly for the other shore, the boat instead moves diagonally relative to the shore, as in Figure 3.40. The boat does not move in the direction in which it is pointed. The reason, of course, is that the river carries the boat downstream. Similarly, if a small airplane flies overhead in a strong crosswind, you can sometimes see that the plane is not moving in the direction in which it is pointed, as illustrated in Figure 3.41. The plane is moving straight ahead relative to the air, but the movement of the air mass relative to the ground carries it sideways.  
FIGURE 3.40 A boat trying to head straight across a river will actually move diagonally relative to the shore as shown. Its total velocity (solid arrow) relative to the shore is the sum of its velocity relative to the river plus the velocity of the river relative to the shore.

  
FIGURE 3.41 An airplane heading straight north is instead carried to the west and slowed down by wind. The plane does not move relative to the ground in the direction it points; rather, it moves in the direction of its total velocity (solid arrow).

In each of these situations, an object has a velocity relative to a medium (such as a river) and that medium has a velocity relative to an observer on solid ground. The velocity of the object relative to the observer is the sum of these velocity vectors, as indicated in Figure 3.40 and Figure 3.41. These situations are only two of many in which it is useful to add velocities. In this module, we first re-examine how to add velocities and then consider certain aspects of what relative velocity means.

How do we add velocities? Velocity is a vector (it has both magnitude and direction); the rules of vector addition discussed in Vector Addition and Subtraction: Graphical Methods and Vector Addition and Subtraction: Analytical Methods apply to the addition of velocities, just as they do for any other vectors. In one-dimensional motion, the addition of velocities is simple—they add like ordinary numbers. For example, if a field hockey player is moving at  straight toward the goal and drives the ball in the same direction with a velocity of  relative to her body, then the velocity of the ball is  relative to the stationary, profusely sweating goalkeeper standing in front of the goal.

In two-dimensional motion, either graphical or analytical techniques can be used to add velocities. We will concentrate on analytical techniques. The following equations give the relationships between the magnitude anddirection of velocity (  and  ) and its components  and  ) along the  and y-axes of an appropriately chosen coordinate system:







  
FIGURE 3.42 The velocity,  , of an object traveling at an angle  to the horizontal axis is the sum of component vectors  and 

These equations are valid for any vectors and are adapted specifically for velocity. The first two equations are used to find the components of a velocity when its magnitude and direction are known. The last two are used to find the magnitude and direction of velocity when its components are known.

# Take-Home Experiment: Relative Velocity of a Boat

Fill a bathtub half-full of water. Take a toy boat or some other object that floats in water. Unplug the drain so water starts to drain. Try pushing the boat from one side of the tub to the other and perpendicular to the flow of water. Which way do you need to push the boat so that it ends up immediately opposite? Compare the directions of the flow of water, heading of the boat, and actual velocity of the boat.# EXAMPLE 3.6

# Adding Velocities: A Boat on a River

  
FIGURE 3.43 A boat attempts to travel straight across a river at a speed  . The current in the river, however, flows at a speed of $ { 1 . 2 0 \ : \mathrm { m } / \mathrm { s } }$ to the right.

Refer to Figure 3.43, which shows a boat trying to go straight across the river. Let us calculate the magnitude and direction of the boat’s velocity relative to an observer on the shore,  . The velocity of the boat,  , is  in the  -direction relative to the river and the velocity of the river,  , is  to the right.

# Strategy

We start by choosing a coordinate system with its  -axis parallel to the velocity of the river, as shown in Figure 3.43. Because the boat is directed straight toward the other shore, its velocity relative to the water is parallel to the  -axis and perpendicular to the velocity of the river. Thus, we can add the two velocities by using the equations  and  directly.

# Solution

The magnitude of the total velocity is



where



and



Thus,



yielding



The direction of the total velocity  is given by:

This equation gives



# Discussion

Both the magnitude  and the direction  of the total velocity are consistent with Figure 3.43. Note that because the velocity of the river is large compared with the velocity of the boat, it is swept rapidly downstream. This result is evidenced by the small angle (only  ) the total velocity has relative to the riverbank.

# EXAMPLE 3.7

# Calculating Velocity: Wind Velocity Causes an Airplane to Drift

Calculate the wind velocity for the situation shown in Figure 3.44. The plane is known to be moving at  due north relative to the air mass, while its velocity relative to the ground (its total velocity) is  in a direction  west of north.

  
FIGURE 3.44 An airplane is known to be heading north at  , though its velocity relative to the ground is  at an angle west of north. What is the speed and direction of the wind?

# Strategy

In this problem, somewhat different from the previous example, we know the total velocity  and that it is the sum of two other velocities,  (the wind) and  (the plane relative to the air mass). The quantity  is known, and we are asked to find  . None of the velocities are perpendicular, but it is possible to find their components along a common set of perpendicular axes. If we can find the components of  , then we can combine them to solve for its magnitude and direction. As shown in Figure 3.44, we choose a coordinate system with its  -axis due east and its y-axis due north (parallel to  ). (You may wish to look back at the discussion of the addition of vectors using perpendicular components in Vector Addition and Subtraction: Analytical Methods.)

# Solution

Because  is the vector sum of the  and  , its  and y-components are the sums of the  and y-components of the wind and plane velocities. Note that the plane only has vertical component of velocity so  and . That is,



and



We can use the first of these two equations to find 



Because  and  we have



The minus sign indicates motion west which is consistent with the diagram.

Now, to find  we note that



Here  ; thus,



This minus sign indicates motion south which is consistent with the diagram.

Now that the perpendicular components of the wind velocity  and  are known, we can find the magnitude and direction of  . First, the magnitude is



so that



The direction is:



giving



# Discussion

The wind’s speed and direction are consistent with the significant effect the wind has on the total velocity of the plane, as seen in Figure 3.44. Because the plane is fighting a strong combination of crosswind and head-wind, it ends up with a total velocity significantly less than its velocity relative to the air mass as well as heading in a different direction.

Note that in both of the last two examples, we were able to make the mathematics easier by choosing a coordinate system with one axis parallel to one of the velocities. We will repeatedly find that choosing an appropriate coordinate system makes problem solving easier. For example, in projectile motion we always use a coordinate system with one axis parallel to gravity.

# Relative Velocities and Classical Relativity

When adding velocities, we have been careful to specify that the velocity is relative to some reference frame. These velocities are called relative velocities. For example, the velocity of an airplane relative to an air mass is different from its velocity relative to the ground. Both are quite different from the velocity of an airplane relative to its passengers (which should be close to zero). Relative velocities are one aspect of relativity, which is defined to be the study of how different observers moving relative to each other measure the same phenomenon.Nearly everyone has heard of relativity and immediately associates it with Albert Einstein (1879–1955), the greatest physicist of the 20th century. Einstein revolutionized our view of nature with his modern theory of relativity, which we shall study in later chapters. The relative velocities in this section are actually aspects of classical relativity, first discussed correctly by Galileo and Isaac Newton. Classical relativity is limited to situations where speeds are less than about  of the speed of light—that is, less than  . Most things we encounter in daily life move slower than this speed.

Let us consider an example of what two different observers see in a situation analyzed long ago by Galileo. Suppose a sailor at the top of a mast on a moving ship drops their binoculars. Where will it hit the deck? Will it hit at the base of the mast, or will it hit behind the mast because the ship is moving forward? The answer is that if air resistance is negligible, the binoculars will hit at the base of the mast at a point directly below its point of release. Now let us consider what two different observers see when the binoculars drop. One observer is on the ship and the other on shore. The binoculars have no horizontal velocity relative to the observer on the ship, and so he sees them fall straight down the mast. (See Figure 3.45.) To the observer on shore, the binoculars and the ship have the same horizontal velocity, so both move the same distance forward while the binoculars are falling. This observer sees the curved path shown in Figure 3.45. Although the paths look different to the different observers, each sees the same result—the binoculars hit at the base of the mast and not behind it. To get the correct description, it is crucial to correctly specify the velocities relative to the observer.

  
FIGURE 3.45 Classical relativity. The same motion as viewed by two different observers. An observer on the moving ship sees the binoculars dropped from the top of its mast fall straight down. An observer on shore sees the binoculars take the curved path, moving forward with the ship. Both observers see the binoculars strike the deck at the base of the mast. The initial horizontal velocity is different relative to the two observers. (The ship is shown moving rather fast to emphasize the effect.)

# EXAMPLE 3.8

# Calculating Relative Velocity: An Airline Passenger Drops a Coin

An airline passenger drops a coin while the plane is moving at  . What is the velocity of the coin when it strikes the floor  below its point of release: (a) Measured relative to the plane? (b) Measured relative to the Earth?  
FIGURE 3.46 The motion of a coin dropped inside an airplane as viewed by two different observers. (a) An observer in the plane sees the coin fall straight down. (b) An observer on the ground sees the coin move almost horizontally.

# Strategy

Both problems can be solved with the techniques for falling objects and projectiles. In part (a), the initial velocity of the coin is zero relative to the plane, so the motion is that of a falling object (one-dimensional). In part (b), the initial velocity is  horizontal relative to the Earth and gravity is vertical, so this motion is a projectile motion. In both parts, it is best to use a coordinate system with vertical and horizontal axes.

# Solution for (a)

Using the given information, we note that the initial velocity and position are zero, and the final position is  . The final velocity can be found using the equation:



Substituting known values into the equation, we get



yielding



We know that the square root of 29.4 has two roots: 5.42 and -5.42. We choose the negative root because we know that the velocity is directed downwards, and we have defined the positive direction to be upwards. There is no initial horizontal velocity relative to the plane and no horizontal acceleration, and so the motion is straight down relative to the plane.

# Solution for (b)

Because the initial vertical velocity is zero relative to the ground and vertical motion is independent of horizontal motion, the final vertical velocity for the coin relative to the ground is  , the same as found in part (a). In contrast to part (a), there now is a horizontal component of the velocity. However, since there is no horizontal acceleration, the initial and final horizontal velocities are the same and  . The  and  -components of velocity can be combined to find the magnitude of the final velocity:

Thus,



yielding



The direction is given by:



so that



# Discussion

In part (a), the final velocity relative to the plane is the same as it would be if the coin were dropped from rest on the Earth and fell  . This result fits our experience; objects in a plane fall the same way when the plane is flying horizontally as when it is at rest on the ground. This result is also true in moving cars. In part (b), an observer on the ground sees a much different motion for the coin. The plane is moving so fast horizontally to begin with that its final velocity is barely greater than the initial velocity. Once again, we see that in two dimensions, vectors do not add like ordinary numbers—the final velocity v in part (b) is not  ; rather, it is  . The velocity’s magnitude had to be calculated to five digits to see any difference from that of the airplane. The motions as seen by different observers (one in the plane and one on the ground) in this example are analogous to those discussed for the binoculars dropped from the mast of a moving ship, except that the velocity of the plane is much larger, so that the two observers see very different paths. (See Figure 3.46.) In addition, both observers see the coin fall  vertically, but the one on the ground also sees it move forward  (this calculation is left for the reader). Thus, one observer sees a vertical path, the other a nearly horizontal path.

# Making Connections: Relativity and Einstein

Because Einstein was able to clearly define how measurements are made (some involve light) and because the speed of light is the same for all observers, the outcomes are spectacularly unexpected. Time varies with observer, energy is stored as increased mass, and more surprises await.

# Section Summary

# 3.1 Kinematics in Two Dimensions: An Introduction

• The shortest path between any two points is a straight line. In two dimensions, this path can be represented by a vector with horizontal and vertical components. The horizontal and vertical components of a vector are independent of one another. Motion in the horizontal direction does not affect motion in the vertical direction, and vice versa.

# 3.4 Projectile Motion

• Projectile motion is the motion of an object through the air that is subject only to the acceleration of gravity. • To solve projectile motion problems, perform the following steps:   
1. Determine a coordinate system. Then, resolve the position and/or velocity of the object in the horizontal and vertical components. The components of position are given by the quantities  and  , and the components of the velocity  are given by  cos  and  sin  , where  is the magnitude of the velocity and  is its direction.   
2. Analyze the motion of the projectile in the horizontal direction using the following equations: Horizontal motion 

  velocity is a constant.

3. Analyze the motion of the projectile in the vertical direction using the following equations:

4. Recombine the horizontal and vertical components of location and/or velocity using the following equations:



• The maximum height  of a projectile launched with initial vertical velocity  is given by    
The maximum horizontal distance traveled by a projectile is called the range. The range  of a projectile on level ground launched at an angle  above the horizontal with initial speed  is given by

Relative velocity is the velocity of an object as observed from a particular reference frame, and it varies dramatically with reference frame.
