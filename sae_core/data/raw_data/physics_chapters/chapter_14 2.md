INTRODUCTION TO HEAT AND HEAT TRANSFER METHODS Energy can exist in many forms and heat is one of the most intriguing. Heat is often hidden, as it only exists when in transit, and is transferred by a number of distinctly different methods. Heat transfer touches every aspect of our lives and helps us understand how the universe functions. It explains the chill we feel on a clear breezy night, or why Earth’s core has yet to cool. This chapter defines and explores heat transfer, its effects, and the methods by which heat is transferred. These topics are fundamental, as well as practical, and will often be referred to in the chapters ahead.

# 14.1 Heat

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Define heat as transfer of energy.

In Work, Energy, and Energy Resources, we defined work as force times distance and learned that work done on an object changes its kinetic energy. We also saw in Temperature, Kinetic Theory, and the Gas Laws that temperature is proportional to the (average) kinetic energy of atoms and molecules. We say that a thermal system has a certaininternal energy: its internal energy is higher if the temperature is higher. If two objects at different temperatures are brought in contact with each other, energy is transferred from the hotter to the colder object until equilibrium is reached and the bodies reach thermal equilibrium (i.e., they are at the same temperature). No work is done by either object, because no force acts through a distance. The transfer of energy is caused by the temperature difference, and ceases once the temperatures are equal. These observations lead to the following definition of heat: Heat is the spontaneous transfer of energy due to a temperature difference.

As noted in Temperature, Kinetic Theory, and the Gas Laws, heat is often confused with temperature. For example, we may say the heat was unbearable, when we actually mean that the temperature was high. Heat is a form of energy, whereas temperature is not. The misconception arises because we are sensitive to the flow of heat, rather than the temperature.

Owing to the fact that heat is a form of energy, it has the SI unit of joule (J). The calorie (cal) is a common unit of energy, defined as the energy needed to change the temperature of  of water by  —specifically, between  and  , since there is a slight temperature dependence. Perhaps the most common unit of heat is the kilocalorie (kcal), which is the energy needed to change the temperature of  of water by  . Since mass is most often specified in kilograms, kilocalorie is commonly used. Food calories (given the notation Cal, and sometimes called “big calorie”) are actually kilocalories (  ), a fact not easily determined from package labeling.

  
FIGURE 14.2 In figure (a) the soft drink and the ice have different temperatures,  and  , and are not in thermal equilibrium. In figure (b), when the soft drink and ice are allowed to interact, energy is transferred until they reach the same temperature  , achieving equilibrium. Heat transfer occurs due to the difference in temperatures. In fact, since the soft drink and ice are both in contact with the surrounding air and bench, the equilibrium temperature will be the same for both.

# Mechanical Equivalent of Heat

It is also possible to change the temperature of a substance by doing work. Work can transfer energy into or out of a system. This realization helped establish the fact that heat is a form of energy. James Prescott Joule (1818–1889) performed many experiments to establish the mechanical equivalent of heat—the work needed to produce the smft shat an n rshent se eoerms, e etmd valu equivalence is



We consider this equation as the conversion between two different units of energy.  
FIGURE 14.3 Schematic depiction of Joule’s experiment that established the equivalence of heat and work.

The figure above shows one of Joule’s most famous experimental setups for demonstrating the mechanical equivalent of heat. It demonstrated that work and heat can produce the same effects, and helped establish the principle of conservation of energy. Gravitational potential energy (PE) (work done by the gravitational force) is converted into kinetic energy (KE), and then randomized by viscosity and turbulence into increased average kinetic energy of atoms and molecules in the system, producing a temperature increase. His contributions to the field of thermodynamics were so significant that the SI unit of energy was named after him.

Heat added or removed from a system changes its internal energy and thus its temperature. Such a temperature increase is observed while cooking. However, adding heat does not necessarily increase the temperature. An example is melting of ice; that is, when a substance changes from one phase to another. Work done on the system or by the system can also change the internal energy of the system. Joule demonstrated that the temperature of a system can be increased by stirring. If an ice cube is rubbed against a rough surface, work is done by the frictional force. A system has a well-defined internal energy, but we cannot say that it has a certain “heat content” or “work content”. We use the phrase “heat transfer” to emphasize its nature.

# CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING

Two samples (A and B) of the same substance are kept in a lab. Someone adds 10 kilojoules (kJ) of heat to one sample, while  of work is done on the other sample. How can you tell to which sample the heat was added?

# Solution

Heat and work both change the internal energy of the substance. However, the properties of the sample only depend on the internal energy so that it is impossible to tell whether heat was added to sample A or B.

# 14.2 Temperature Change and Heat Capacity

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

: Observe heat transfer and change in temperature and mass.   
• Calculate final temperature after heat transfer between two objects.

One of the major effects of heat transfer is temperature change: heating increases the temperature while cooling decreases it. We assume that there is no phase change and that no work is done on or by the system. Experiments show that the transferred heat depends on three factors—the change in temperature, the mass of the system, and the substance and phase of the substance.  
FIGURE 14.4 The heat  transferred to cause a temperature change depends on the magnitude of the temperature change, the mass of the system, and the substance and phase involved. (a) The amount of heat transferred is directly proportional to the temperature change. To double the temperature change of a mass  , you need to add twice the heat. (b) The amount of heat transferred is also directly proportional to the mass. To cause an equivalent temperature change in a doubled mass, you need to add twice the heat. (c) The amount of heat transferred depends on the substance and its phase. If it takes an amount  of heat to cause a temperature change  in a given mass of copper, it will take 10.8 times that amount of heat to cause the equivalent temperature change in the same mass of water assuming no phase change in either substance.

The dependence on temperature change and mass are easily understood. Owing to the fact that the (average) kinetic energy of an atom or molecule is proportional to the absolute temperature, the internal energy of a system is proportional to the absolute temperature and the number of atoms or molecules. Owing to the fact that the transferred heat is equal to the change in the internal energy, the heat is proportional to the mass of the substance and the temperature change. The transferred heat also depends on the substance so that, for example, the heat necessary to raise the temperature is less for alcohol than for water. For the same substance, the transferred heat also depends on the phase (gas, liquid, or solid).

# Heat Transfer and Temperature Change

The quantitative relationship between heat transfer and temperature change contains all three factors:



where  is the symbol for heat transfer,  is the mass of the substance, and  is the change in temperature. The symbol  stands for specific heat and depends on the material and phase. The specific heat is the amount of heat necessary to change the temperature of  of mass by  . The specific heat  is a property of the substance; its SI unit is  or  Recall that the temperature change  is the same in units of kelvin and degrees Celsius. If heat transfer is measured in kilocalories, then the unit of specific heat is 

Values of specific heat must generally be looked up in tables, because there is no simple way to calculate them. In general, the specific heat also depends on the temperature. Table 14.1 lists representative values of specific heat for various substances. Except for gases, the temperature and volume dependence of the specific heat of most substances is weak. We see from this table that the specific heat of water is five times that of glass and ten times that of iron, which means that it takes five times as much heat to raise the temperature of water the same amount as for glass and ten times as much heat to raise the temperature of water as for iron. In fact, water has one of the largest specific heats of any material, which is important for sustaining life on Earth.# EXAMPLE 14.1

# Calculating the Required Heat: Heating Water in an Aluminum Pan

A 0.500 kg aluminum pan on a stove is used to heat 0.250 liters of water from  to  . (a) How much heat is required? What percentage of the heat is used to raise the temperature of (b) the pan and (c) the water?

# Strategy

The pan and the water are always at the same temperature. When you put the pan on the stove, the temperature of the water and the pan is increased by the same amount. We use the equation for the heat transfer for the given temperature change and mass of water and aluminum. The specific heat values for water and aluminum are given in Table 14.1.

# Solution

Because water is in thermal contact with the aluminum, the pan and the water are at the same temperature.

1. Calculate the temperature difference:



2. Calculate the mass of water. Because the density of water is  , one liter of water has a mass of  and the mass of 0.250 liters of water is  .

3. Calculate the heat transferred to the water. Use the specific heat of water in Table 14.1: 

4. Calculate the heat transferred to the aluminum. Use the specific heat for aluminum in Table 14.1:



5. Compare the percentage of heat going into the pan versus that going into the water. First, find the total transferred heat:



Thus, the amount of heat going into heating the pan is



and the amount going into heating the water is



# Discussion

In this example, the heat transferred to the container is a significant fraction of the total transferred heat. Although the mass of the pan is twice that of the water, the specific heat of water is over four times greater than that of aluminum. Therefore, it takes a bit more than twice the heat to achieve the given temperature change for the water as compared to the aluminum pan.  
FIGURE 14.5 The smoking brakes on this truck are a visible evidence of the mechanical equivalent of heat.

# EXAMPLE 14.2

# Calculating the Temperature Increase from the Work Done on a Substance: Truck Brakes Overheat on Downhill Runs

Truck brakes used to control speed on a downhill run do work, converting gravitational potential energy into increased internal energy (higher temperature) of the brake material. This conversion prevents the gravitational potential energy from being converted into kinetic energy of the truck. The problem is that the mass of the truck is large compared with that of the brake material absorbing the energy, and the temperature increase may occur too fast for sufficient heat to transfer from the brakes to the environment.

Calculate the temperature increase of  of brake material with an average specific heat of  if the material retains  of the energy from a 10,000-kg truck descending  (in vertical displacement) at a constant speed.

# Strategy

If the brakes are not applied, gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. When brakes are applied, gravitational potential energy is converted into internal energy of the brake material. We first calculate the gravitational potential energy  that the entire truck loses in its descent and then find the temperature increase produced in the brake material alone.

# Solution

1. Calculate the change in gravitational potential energy as the truck goes downhill 

2. Calculate the temperature from the heat transferred using  and



where  is the mass of the brake material. Insert the values  and  to find



# Discussion

This same idea underlies the recent hybrid technology of cars, where mechanical energy (gravitational potential energy) is converted by the brakes into electrical energy (battery).<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=3>Substances                   Specific heat (c)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Solids</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>J(kgC)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>kcal(kg)1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Aluminum</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>900</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.215</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Asbestos</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>800</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.19</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Concrete, granite (average)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>840</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.20</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Copper</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>387</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.0924</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Glass</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>840</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.20</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Gold</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>129</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.0308</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Human body (average at 37 °C)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3500</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.83</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Ice (average, -50°C to 0°C)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2090</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.50</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Iron, steel</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>452</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.108</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Lead</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>128</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.0305</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Silver</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>235</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.0562</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Wood</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1700</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.4</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Liquids</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Benzene</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1740</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.415</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Ethanol</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2450</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.586</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Glycerin</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2410</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.576</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Mercury</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>139</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.0333</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Water (15.0 C)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>4186</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.000</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Gases2</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>(</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>()</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Air (dry)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>721 (1015)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.172 (0.242)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Ammonia</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1670 (2190)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.399 (0.523)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Carbon dioxide</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>638 (833)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.152 (0.199)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Nitrogen</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>739 (1040)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.177 (0.248)</td></tr></table>TABLE 14.1 Specific Heats3 of Various Substances

Note that Example 14.2 is an illustration of the mechanical equivalent of heat. Alternatively, the temperature increase could be produced by a blow torch instead of mechanically.

# EXAMPLE 14.3

# Calculating the Final Temperature When Heat Is Transferred Between Two Bodies: Pouring Cold Water in a Hot Pan

Suppose you pour  of  water (about a cup) into a 0.500-kg aluminum pan off the stove with a temperature of  . Assume that the pan is placed on an insulated pad and that a negligible amount of water boils off. What is the temperature when the water and pan reach thermal equilibrium a short time later?

# Strategy

The pan is placed on an insulated pad so that little heat transfer occurs with the surroundings. Originally the pan and water are not in thermal equilibrium: the pan is at a higher temperature than the water. Heat transfer then restores thermal equilibrium once the water and pan are in contact. Because heat transfer between the pan and water takes place rapidly, the mass of evaporated water is negligible and the magnitude of the heat lost by the pan is equal to the heat gained by the water. The exchange of heat stops once a thermal equilibrium between the pan and the water is achieved. The heat exchange can be written as  .

# Solution

1. Use the equation for heat transfer  to express the heat lost by the aluminum pan in terms of the mass of the pan, the specific heat of aluminum, the initial temperature of the pan, and the final temperature:  14.12

2. Express the heat gained by the water in terms of the mass of the water, the specific heat of water, the initial temperature of the water and the final temperature:



3. Note that  and  and that they must sum to zero because the heat lost by the hot pan must be the same as the heat gained by the cold water:



Bring all terms involving  on the left hand side and all other terms on the right hand side. Solve for



and insert the numerical values:

# Discussion

This is a typical calorimetry problem—two bodies at different temperatures are brought in contact with each other and exchange heat until a common temperature is reached. Why is the final temperature so much closer to  than  The reason is that water has a greater specific heat than most common substances and thus undergoes a small temperature change for a given heat transfer. A large body of water, such as a lake, requires a large amount of heat to increase its temperature appreciably. This explains why the temperature of a lake stays relatively constant during a day even when the temperature change of the air is large. However, the water temperature does change over longer times (e.g., summer to winter).

# Take-Home Experiment: Temperature Change of Land and Water

What heats faster, land or water?

To study differences in heat capacity:

Place equal masses of dry sand (or soil) and water at the same temperature into two small jars. (The average density of soil or sand is about 1.6 times that of water, so you can achieve approximately equal masses by using  more water by volume.) Heat both (using an oven or a heat lamp) for the same amount of time.   
• Record the final temperature of the two masses.   
• Now bring both jars to the same temperature by heating for a longer period of time.   
• Remove the jars from the heat source and measure their temperature every 5 minutes for about 30 minutes.

Which sample cools off the fastest? This activity replicates the phenomena responsible for land breezes and sea breezes.

# CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING

If  is necessary to raise the temperature of a block from  to  , how much heat is necessary to heat the block from  to 

# Solution

The heat transfer depends only on the temperature difference. Since the temperature differences are the same in both cases, the same  is necessary in the second case.

# 14.3 Phase Change and Latent Heat

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Examine heat transfer. • Calculate final temperature from heat transfer.

So far we have discussed temperature change due to heat transfer. No temperature change occurs from heat transfer if ice melts and becomes liquid water (i.e., during a phase change). For example, consider water dripping from icicles melting on a roof warmed by the Sun. Conversely, water freezes in an ice tray cooled by lowertemperature surroundings.  
FIGURE 14.6 Heat from the air transfers to the ice causing it to melt. (credit: Mike Brand)

Energy is required to melt a solid because the cohesive bonds between the molecules in the solid must be broken apart such that, in the liquid, the molecules can move around at comparable kinetic energies; thus, there is no rise in temperature. Similarly, energy is needed to vaporize a liquid, because molecules in a liquid interact with each other via attractive forces. There is no temperature change until a phase change is complete. The temperature of a cup of soda initially at  stays at  until all the ice has melted. Conversely, energy is released during freezing and condensation, usually in the form of thermal energy. Work is done by cohesive forces when molecules are brought together. The corresponding energy must be given off (dissipated) to allow them to stay together Figure 14.7.

The energy involved in a phase change depends on two major factors: the number and strength of bonds or force pairs. The number of bonds is proportional to the number of molecules and thus to the mass of the sample. The strength of forces depends on the type of molecules. The heat  required to change the phase of a sample of mass  is given by



where the latent heat of fusion,  , and latent heat of vaporization,  , are material constants that are determined experimentally. See (Table 14.2).  
FIGURE 14.7 (a) Energy is required to partially overcome the attractive forces between molecules in a solid to form a liquid. That same energy must be removed for freezing to take place. (b) Molecules are separated by large distances when going from liquid to vapor, requiring significant energy to overcome molecular attraction. The same energy must be removed for condensation to take place. There is no temperature change until a phase change is complete.

Latent heat is measured in units of  . Both  and  depend on the substance, particularly on the strength of its molecular forces as noted earlier.  and  are collectively called latent heat coefficients. They are latent, or hidden, because in phase changes, energy enters or leaves a system without causing a temperature change in the system; so, in effect, the energy is hidden. Table 14.2 lists representative values of  and  , together with melting and boiling points.

The table shows that significant amounts of energy are involved in phase changes. Let us look, for example, at how much energy is needed to melt a kilogram of ice at  to produce a kilogram of water at  . Using the equation for a change in temperature and the value for water from Table 14.2, we find that  is the energy to melt a kilogram of ice. This is a lot of energy as it represents the same amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of  of liquid water from  to  . Even more energy is required to vaporize water; it would take  to change  of liquid water at the normal boiling point (  at atmospheric pressure) to steam (water vapor). This example shows that the energy for a phase change is enormous compared to energy associated with temperature changes without a phase change.

Similarly, temperatures in humid weather rarely fall below the dew point because enormous heat is released when water vapor condenses.

We examine the effects of phase change more precisely by considering adding heat into a sample of ice at  (Figure 14.8). The temperature of the ice rises linearly, absorbing heat at a constant rate of   until it reaches  . Once at this temperature, the ice begins to melt until all the ice has melted, absorbing  of heat. The temperature remains constant at  during this phase change. Once all the ice has melted, the temperature of the liquid water rises, absorbing heat at a new constant rate of  . At  , the water begins to boil and the temperature again remains constant while the water absorbs  of heat during this phase change. When all the liquid has become steam vapor, the temperature rises again, absorbing heat at a rate of  .  
FIGURE 14.8 A graph of temperature versus energy added. The system is constructed so that no vapor evaporates while ice warms to become liquid water, and so that, when vaporization occurs, the vapor remains in of the system. The long stretches of constant temperature values at  and  reflect the large latent heat of melting and vaporization, respectively.

Water can evaporate at temperatures below the boiling point. More energy is required than at the boiling point, because the kinetic energy of water molecules at temperatures below  is less than that at  , hence less energy is available from random thermal motions. Take, for example, the fact that, at body temperature, perspiration from the skin requires a heat input of  which is about 10 percent higher than the latent heat of vaporization at  . This heat comes from the skin, and thus provides an effective cooling mechanism in hot weather. High humidity inhibits evaporation, so that body temperature might rise, leaving unevaporated sweat on your brow.

# EXAMPLE 14.4

# Calculate Final Temperature from Phase Change: Cooling Soda with Ice Cubes

Three ice cubes are used to chill a soda at  with mass  . The ice is at  and each ice cube has a mass of  . Assume that the soda is kept in a foam container so that heat loss can be ignored. Assume the soda has the same heat capacity as water. Find the final temperature when all ice has melted.

# Strategy

The ice cubes are at the melting temperature of  . Heat is transferred from the soda to the ice for melting. Melting of ice occurs in two steps: first the phase change occurs and solid (ice) transforms into liquid water at the melting temperature, then the temperature of this water rises. Melting yields water at  , so more heat is transferred from the soda to this water until the water plus soda system reaches thermal equilibrium,



The heat transferred to the ice is  . The heat given off by the soda is  . Since no heat is lost,  , so that



Bring all terms involving  on the left-hand-side and all other terms on the right-hand-side. Solve for the unknown quantity  :



# Solution

1. Identify the known quantities. The mass of ice is  and the mass of soda is  .2. Calculate the terms in the numerator:



and



3. Calculate the denominator:



4. Calculate the final temperature:



# Discussion

This example illustrates the enormous energies involved during a phase change. The mass of ice is about 7 percent the mass of water but leads to a noticeable change in the temperature of soda. Although we assumed that the ice was at the freezing temperature, this is incorrect: the typical temperature is  . However, this correction gives a final temperature that is essentially identical to the result we found. Can you explain why?

We have seen that vaporization requires heat transfer to a liquid from the surroundings, so that energy is released by the surroundings. Condensation is the reverse process, increasing the temperature of the surroundings. This increase may seem surprising, since we associate condensation with cold objects—the glass in the figure, for example. However, energy must be removed from the condensing molecules to make a vapor condense. The energy is exactly the same as that required to make the phase change in the other direction, from liquid to vapor, and so it can be calculated from  .

  
FIGURE 14.9 Condensation forms on this glass of iced tea because the temperature of the nearby air is reduced to below the dew point. The rate at which water molecules join together exceeds the rate at which they separate, and so water condenses. Energy is released when the water condenses, speeding the melting of the ice in the glass. (credit: Jenny Downing)

# Real-World Application

Energy is also released when a liquid freezes. This phenomenon is used by fruit growers in Florida to protect oranges when the temperature is close to the freezing point  . Growers spray water on the plants in orchards so that the water freezes and heat is released to the growing oranges on the trees. This prevents the temperature inside the orange from dropping below freezing, which would damage the fruit.  
FIGURE 14.10 The ice on these trees released large amounts of energy when it froze, helping to prevent the temperature of the trees from dropping below  . Water is intentionally sprayed on orchards to help prevent hard frosts. (credit: Hermann Hammer)

Sublimation is the transition from solid to vapor phase. You may have noticed that snow can disappear into thin air without a trace of liquid water, or the disappearance of ice cubes in a freezer. The reverse is also true: Frost can form on very cold windows without going through the liquid stage. A popular effect is the making of “smoke” from dry ice, which is solid carbon dioxide. Sublimation occurs because the equilibrium vapor pressure of solids is not zero. Certain air fresheners use the sublimation of a solid to inject a perfume into the room. Moth balls are a slightly toxic example of a phenol (an organic compound) that sublimates, while some solids, such as osmium tetroxide, are so toxic that they must be kept in sealed containers to prevent human exposure to their sublimation-produced vapors.

  
FIGURE 14.11 Direct transitions between solid and vapor are common, sometimes useful, and even beautiful. (a) Dry ice sublimates directly to carbon dioxide gas. The visible vapor is made of water droplets. (credit: Windell Oskay) (b) Frost forms patterns on a very cold window, an example of a solid formed directly from a vapor. (credit: Liz West)

All phase transitions involve heat. In the case of direct solid-vapor transitions, the energy required is given by the equation  , where  is the heat of sublimation, which is the energy required to change  of a substance from the solid phase to the vapor phase.  is analogous to  and  , and its value depends on the substance. Sublimation requires energy input, so that dry ice is an effective coolant, whereas the reverse process (i.e., frosting) releases energy. The amount of energy required for sublimation is of the same order of magnitude asthat for other phase transitions.

The material presented in this section and the preceding section allows us to calculate any number of effects related to temperature and phase change. In each case, it is necessary to identify which temperature and phase changes are taking place and then to apply the appropriate equation. Keep in mind that heat transfer and work can cause both temperature and phase changes.

# Problem-Solving Strategies for the Effects of Heat Transfer

1. Examine the situation to determine that there is a change in the temperature or phase. Is there heat transfer iohes?Whene pec s ha han  iuymay wis solve the problem as if there were no phase changes, and examine the temperature change obtained. If it is sufficient to take you past a boiling or melting point, you should then go back and do the problem in steps—temperature change, phase change, subsequent temperature change, and so on.   
2. Identify and list all objects that change temperature and phase.   
3. Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns). A written list is useful.   
4. Make a list of what is given or what can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns).   
5. Solve the appropriate equation for the quantity to be determined (the unknown). If there is a temperature change, the transferred heat depends on the specific heat (see Table 14.1) whereas, for a phase change, the transferred heat depends on the latent heat. See Table 14.2.   
6. Substitute the knowns along with their units into the appropriate equation and obtain numerical solutions temperature change followed by a phase change).   
7. Check the answer to see if it is reasonable: Does it make sense? As an example, be certain that the temperature change does not also cause a phase change that you have not taken into account.

# CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING

Why does snow remain on mountain slopes even when daytime temperatures are higher than the freezing temperature?

# Solution

Snow is formed from ice crystals and thus is the solid phase of water. Because enormous heat is necessary for phase changes, it takes a certain amount of time for this heat to be accumulated from the air, even if the air is above  . The warmer the air is, the faster this heat exchange occurs and the faster the snow melts.

# 14.4 Heat Transfer Methods

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Discuss the different methods of heat transfer.

Equally as interesting as the effects of heat transfer on a system are the methods by which this occurs. Whenever there is a temperature difference, heat transfer occurs. Heat transfer may occur rapidly, such as through a cooking pan, or slowly, such as through the walls of a picnic ice chest. We can control rates of heat transfer by choosing materials (such as thick wool clothing for the winter), controlling air movement (such as the use of weather stripping around doors), or by choice of color (such as a white roof to reflect summer sunlight). So many processes involve heat transfer, so that it is hard to imagine a situation where no heat transfer occurs. Yet every process involving heat transfer takes place by only three methods:

1. Conduction is heat transfer through stationary matter by physical contact. (The matter is stationary on a macroscopic scale—we know there is thermal motion of the atoms and molecules at any temperature above absolute zero.) Heat transferred between the electric burner of a stove and the bottom of a pan is transferred by conduction.

2. Convection is the heat transfer by the macroscopic movement of a fluid. This type of transfer takes place in a forced-air furnace and in weather systems, for example.

3. Heat transfer by radiation occurs when microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, or another form of electromagnetic radiation is emitted or absorbed. An obvious example is the warming of the Earth by the Sun. Aless obvious example is thermal radiation from the human body.

  
FIGURE 14.12 In a fireplace, heat transfer occurs by all three methods: conduction, convection, and radiation. Radiation is responsible for most of the heat transferred into the room. Heat transfer also occurs through conduction into the room, but at a much slower rate. Heat transfer by convection also occurs through cold air entering the room around windows and hot air leaving the room by rising up the chimney.

We examine these methods in some detail in the three following modules. Each method has unique and interesting characteristics, but all three do have one thing in common: they transfer heat solely because of a temperature difference Figure 14.12.

# CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING

Name an example from daily life (different from the text) for each mechanism of heat transfer.

# Solution

Conduction: Heat transfers into your hands as you hold a hot cup of coffee.

Convection: Heat transfers as the barista “steams” cold milk to make hot cocoa.

Radiation: Reheating a cold cup of coffee in a microwave oven.

# 14.5 Conduction

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Calculate thermal conductivity.   
Observe conduction of heat in collisions.   
Study thermal conductivities of common substances.  
FIGURE 14.13 Insulation is used to limit the conduction of heat from the inside to the outside (in winters) and from the outside to the inside (in summers). (credit: Giles Douglas)

Your feet feel cold as you walk barefoot across the living room carpet in your cold house and then step onto the kitchen tile floor. This result is intriguing, since the carpet and tile floor are both at the same temperature. The different sensation you feel is explained by the different rates of heat transfer: the heat loss during the same time interval is greater for skin in contact with the tiles than with the carpet, so the temperature drop is greater on the tiles.

Some materials conduct thermal energy faster than others. In general, good conductors of electricity (metals like copper, aluminum, gold, and silver) are also good heat conductors, whereas insulators of electricity (wood, plastic, and rubber) are poor heat conductors. Figure 14.14 shows molecules in two bodies at different temperatures. The (average) kinetic energy of a molecule in the hot body is higher than in the colder body. If two molecules collide, an energy transfer from the molecule with greater kinetic energy to the molecule with less kinetic energy occurs. The cumulative effect from all collisions results in a net flux of heat from the hot body to the colder body. The heat flux thus depends on the temperature difference  . Therefore, you will get a more severe burn from boiling water than from hot tap water. Conversely, if the temperatures are the same, the net heat transfer rate falls to zero, and equilibrium is achieved. Owing to the fact that the number of collisions increases with increasing area, heat conduction depends on the cross-sectional area. If you touch a cold wall with your palm, your hand cools faster than if you just touch it with your fingertip.

  
FIGURE 14.14 The molecules in two bodies at different temperatures have different average kinetic energies. Collisions occurring at the contact surface tend to transfer energy from high-temperature regions to low-temperature regions. In this illustration, a molecule in the lower temperature region (right side) has low energy before collision, but its energy increases after colliding with the contact surface. In contrast, a molecule in the higher temperature region (left side) has high energy before collision, but its energy decreases after collidingwith the contact surface.

A third factor in the mechanism of conduction is the thickness of the material through which heat transfers. The figure below shows a slab of material with different temperatures on either side. Suppose that  is greater than  , so that heat is transferred from left to right. Heat transfer from the left side to the right side is accomplished by a series of molecular collisions. The thicker the material, the more time it takes to transfer the same amount of heat. This model explains why thick clothing is warmer than thin clothing in winters, and why Arctic mammals protect themselves with thick blubber.

  
FIGURE 14.15 Heat conduction occurs through any material, represented here by a rectangular bar, whether window glass or walrus blubber. The temperature of the material is  on the left and  on the right, where  is greater than  . The rate of heat transfer by conduction is directly proportional to the surface area  , the temperature difference  , and the substance’s conductivity  . The rate of heat transfer is inversely proportional to the thickness  .

Lastly, the heat transfer rate depends on the material properties described by the coefficient of thermal conductivity. All four factors are included in a simple equation that was deduced from and is confirmed by experiments. The rate of conductive heat transfer through a slab of material, such as the one in Figure 14.15, is given by



where  is the rate of heat transfer in watts or kilocalories per second,  is the thermal conductivity of the material,  and  are its surface area and thickness, as shown in Figure 14.15, and  is the temperature difference across the slab. Table 14.3 gives representative values of thermal conductivity.

# EXAMPLE 14.5

# Calculating Heat Transfer Through Conduction: Conduction Rate Through an Ice Box

A Styrofoam ice box has a total area of  and walls with an average thickness of  . The box contains ice, water, and canned beverages at  . The inside of the box is kept cold by melting ice. How much ice melts in one day if the ice box is kept in the trunk of a car at 

# Strategy

This question involves both heat for a phase change (melting of ice) and the transfer of heat by conduction. To find the amount of ice melted, we must find the net heat transferred. This value can be obtained by calculating the rate of heat transfer by conduction and multiplying by time.

# Solution

1. Identify the knowns.







2. Identify the unknowns. We need to solve for the mass of the ice,  . We will also need to solve for the net heat transferred to melt the ice,  .

3. Determine which equations to use. The rate of heat transfer by conduction is given by



4. The heat is used to melt the ice: 

5. Insert the known values:



6. Multiply the rate of heat transfer by the time  :



7. Set this equal to the heat transferred to melt the ice:  . Solve for the mass  :



# Discussion

The result of  , or about 7.6 lbs, seems about right, based on experience. You might expect to use about a 4 kg (7–10 lb) bag of ice per day. A little extra ice is required if you add any warm food or beverages.

Inspecting the conductivities in Table 14.3 shows that Styrofoam is a very poor conductor and thus a good insulator. Other good insulators include fiberglass, wool, and goose-down feathers. Like Styrofoam, these all incorporate many small pockets of air, taking advantage of air’s poor thermal conductivity.

A combination of material and thickness is often manipulated to develop good insulators—the smaller the conductivity  and the larger the thickness  , the better. The ratio of will thus be large for a good insulator. The ratio  is called the  factor. The rate of conductive heat transfer is inversely proportional to  . The larger the value of  , the better the insulation.  factors are most commonly quoted for household insulation, refrigerators, and the like—unfortunately, it is still in non-metric units of ft2·°F·h/Btu, although the unit usually goes unstated (1 British thermal unit [Btu] is the amount of energy needed to change the temperature of 1.0 lb of water by  ). A couple of representative values are an  factor of 11 for 3.5-in-thick fiberglass batts (pieces) of insulation and an  factor of 19 for 6.5-in-thick fiberglass batts. Walls are usually insulated with 3.5-in batts, while ceilings are usually insulated with 6.5-in batts. In cold climates, thicker batts may be used in ceilings and walls.

  
FIGURE 14.16 The fiberglass batt is used for insulation of walls and ceilings to prevent heat transfer between the inside of the building and the outside environment.

Note that in Table 14.3, the best thermal conductors—silver, copper, gold, and aluminum—are also the best electrical conductors, again related to the density of free electrons in them. Cooking utensils are typically made from good conductors.# EXAMPLE 14.6

# Calculating the Temperature Difference Maintained by a Heat Transfer: Conduction Through an Aluminum Pan

Water is boiling in an aluminum pan placed on an electrical element on a stovetop. The sauce pan has a bottom that is  thick and  in diameter. The boiling water is evaporating at the rate of  . What is the temperature difference across (through) the bottom of the pan?

# Strategy

Conduction through the aluminum is the primary method of heat transfer here, and so we use the equation for the rate of heat transfer and solve for the temperature difference.



# Solution

1. Identify the knowns and convert them to the SI units. The thickness of the pan,  the area of the pan,  , and the thermal conductivity, 

2. Calculate the necessary heat of vaporization of  of water:



3. Calculate the rate of heat transfer given that  of water melts in one second:  or 

4. Insert the knowns into the equation and solve for the temperature difference:



# Discussion

The value for the heat transfer  or  is typical for an electric stove. This value gives a remarkably small temperature difference between the stove and the pan. Consider that the stove burner is red hot while the inside of the pan is nearly  because of its contact with boiling water. This contact effectively cools the bottom of the pan in spite of its proximity to the very hot stove burner. Aluminum is such a good conductor that it only takes this small temperature difference to produce a heat transfer of  into the pan.

Conduction is caused by the random motion of atoms and molecules. As such, it is an ineffective mechanism for heat transport over macroscopic distances and short time distances. Take, for example, the temperature on the Earth, which would be unbearably cold during the night and extremely hot during the day if heat transport in the atmosphere was to be only through conduction. In another example, car engines would overheat unless there was a more efficient way to remove excess heat from the pistons.

# CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING

How does the rate of heat transfer by conduction change when all spatial dimensions are doubled?

# Solution

Because area is the product of two spatial dimensions, it increases by a factor of four when each dimension is doubled  . The distance, however, simply doubles. Because the temperature difference and the coefficient of thermal conductivity are independent of the spatial dimensions, the rate of heat transfer by conduction increases by a factor of four divided by two, or two:

# 14.6 Convection

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Discuss the method of heat transfer by convection.

Convection is driven by large-scale flow of matter. In the case of Earth, the atmospheric circulation is caused by the flow of hot air from the tropics to the poles, and the flow of cold air from the poles toward the tropics. (Note that Earth’s rotation causes the observed easterly flow of air in the northern hemisphere). Car engines are kept cool by the flow of water in the cooling system, with the water pump maintaining a flow of cool water to the pistons. The circulatory system is used the body: when the body overheats, the blood vessels in the skin expand (dilate), which increases the blood flow to the skin where it can be cooled by sweating. These vessels become smaller when it is cold outside and larger when it is hot (so more fluid flows, and more energy is transferred).

The body also loses a significant fraction of its heat through the breathing process.

While convection is usually more complicated than conduction, we can describe convection and do some straightforward, realistic calculations of its effects. Natural convection is driven by buoyant forces: hot air rises because density decreases as temperature increases. The house in Figure 14.17 is kept warm in this manner, as is the pot of water on the stove in Figure 14.18. Ocean currents and large-scale atmospheric circulation transfer energy from one part of the globe to another. Both are examples of natural convection.

  
FIGURE 14.17 Air heated by the so-called gravity furnace expands and rises, forming a convective loop that transfers energy to other parts of the room. As the air is cooled at the ceiling and outside walls, it contracts, eventually becoming denser than room air and sinking to the floor. A properly designed heating system using natural convection, like this one, can be quite efficient in uniformly heating a home.

  
FIGURE 14.18 Convection plays an important role in heat transfer inside this pot of water. Once conducted to the inside, heat transfer to other parts of the pot is mostly by convection. The hotter water expands, decreases in density, and rises to transfer heat to other regions of the water, while colder water sinks to the bottom. This process keeps repeating.# Take-Home Experiment: Convection Rolls in a Heated Pan

Take two small pots of water and use an eye dropper to place a drop of food coloring near the bottom of each. Leave one on a bench top and heat the other over a stovetop. Watch how the color spreads and how long it takes the color to reach the top. Watch how convective loops form.

# EXAMPLE 14.7

# Calculating Heat Transfer by Convection: Convection of Air Through the Walls of a House

Most houses are not airtight: air goes in and out around doors and windows, through cracks and crevices, following wiring to switches and outlets, and so on. The air in a typical house is completely replaced in less than an hour. Suppose that a moderately-sized house has inside dimensions  high, and that all air is replaced in  . Calculate the heat transfer per unit time in watts needed to warm the incoming cold air by  , thus replacing the heat transferred by convection alone.

# Strategy

Heat is used to raise the temperature of air so that  . The rate of heat transfer is then  , where  is the time for air turnover. We are given that  is  , but we must still find values for the mass of air and its specific heat before we can calculate  . The specific heat of air is a weighted average of the specific heats of nitrogen and oxygen, which gives  from Table 14.1 (note that the specific heat at constant pressure must be used for this process).

# Solution

1. Determine the mass of air from its density and the given volume of the house. The density is given from the density  and the volume



2. Calculate the heat transferred from the change in air temperature:  so that



3. Calculate the heat transfer from the heat  and the turnover time  . Since air is turned over in  , the heat transferred per unit time is



# Discussion

This rate of heat transfer is equal to the power consumed by about forty-six 100-W light bulbs. Newly constructed homes are designed for a turnover time of 2 hours or more, rather than 30 minutes for the house of this example. Weather stripping, caulking, and improved window seals are commonly employed. More extreme measures are sometimes taken in very cold (or hot) climates to achieve a tight standard of more than 6 hours for one air turnover. Still longer turnover times are unhealthy, because a minimum amount of fresh air is necessary to supply oxygen for breathing and to dilute household pollutants. The term used for the process by which outside air leaks into the house from cracks around windows, doors, and the foundation is called “air infiltration.”

A cold wind is much more chilling than still cold air, because convection combines with conduction in the body to increase the rate at which energy is transferred away from the body. The table below gives approximate wind-chill factors, which are the temperatures of still air that produce the same rate of cooling as air of a given temperature and speed. Wind-chill factors are a dramatic reminder of convection’s ability to transfer heat faster than conduction. For example, a  wind at  has the chilling equivalent of still air at about  .TABLE 14.4 Wind-Chill Factors

Although air can transfer heat rapidly by convection, it is a poor conductor and thus a good insulator. The amount of available space for airflow determines whether air acts as an insulator or conductor. The space between the inside and outside walls of a house, for example, is about  (3.5 in) —large enough for convection to work effectively. The addition of wall insulation prevents airflow, so heat loss (or gain) is decreased. Similarly, the gap between the two panes of a double-paned window is about 1 cm, which prevents convection and takes advantage of air’s low conductivity to prevent greater loss. Fur, fiber, and fiberglass also take advantage of the low conductivity of air by trapping it in spaces too small to support convection, as shown in the figure. Fur and feathers are lightweight and thus ideal for the protection of animals.

  
FIGURE 14.19 Fur is filled with air, breaking it up into many small pockets. Convection is very slow here, because the loops are so small. The low conductivity of air makes fur a very good lightweight insulator.

Some interesting phenomena happen when convection is accompanied by a phase change. It allows us to cool off by sweating, even if the temperature of the surrounding air exceeds body temperature. Heat from the skin is required for sweat to evaporate from the skin, but without air flow, the air becomes saturated and evaporation stops. Air flow caused by convection replaces the saturated air by dry air and evaporation continues.# EXAMPLE 14.8

# Calculate the Flow of Mass during Convection: Sweat-Heat Transfer away from the Body

The average person produces heat at the rate of about 120 W when at rest. At what rate must water evaporate from the body to get rid of all this energy? (This evaporation might occur when a person is sitting in the shade and surrounding temperatures are the same as skin temperature, eliminating heat transfer by other methods.)

# Strategy

Energy is needed for a phase change  ). Thus, the energy loss per unit time is



We divide both sides of the equation by  to find that the mass evaporated per unit time is



# Solution

(1) Insert the value of the latent heat from Table 14.2,  . This yields



# Discussion

Evaporating about 3  seems reasonable. This would be about  (about 7 oz) per hour. If the air is very dry, the sweat may evaporate without even being noticed. A significant amount of evaporation also takes place in the lungs and breathing passages.

Another important example of the combination of phase change and convection occurs when water evaporates from the oceans. Heat is removed from the ocean when water evaporates. If the water vapor condenses in liquid droplets as clouds form, heat is released in the atmosphere. Thus, there is an overall transfer of heat from the ocean to the atmosphere. This process is the driving power behind thunderheads, those great cumulus clouds that rise as much as  into the stratosphere. Water vapor carried in by convection condenses, releasing tremendous amounts of energy. This energy causes the air to expand and rise, where it is colder. More condensation occurs in these colder regions, which in turn drives the cloud even higher. Such a mechanism is called positive feedback, since the process reinforces and accelerates itself. These systems sometimes produce violent storms, with lightning and hail, and constitute the mechanism driving hurricanes.  
FIGURE 14.20 Cumulus clouds are caused by water vapor that rises because of convection. The rise of clouds is driven by a positive feedback mechanism. (credit: Mike Love)

  
FIGURE 14.21 Convection accompanied by a phase change releases the energy needed to drive this thunderhead into the stratosphere. (credit: Gerardo García Moretti )

  
FIGURE 14.22 The phase change that occurs when this iceberg melts involves tremendous heat transfer. (credit: Dominic Alves)

The movement of icebergs is another example of convection accompanied by a phase change. Suppose an iceberg drifts from Greenland into warmer Atlantic waters. Heat is removed from the warm ocean water when the ice melts and heat is released to the land mass when the iceberg forms on Greenland.

# CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING

Explain why using a fan in the summer feels refreshing!# Solution

Using a fan increases the flow of air: warm air near your body is replaced by cooler air from elsewhere. Convection increases the rate of heat transfer so that moving air “feels” cooler than still air.

# 14.7 Radiation

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Discuss heat transfer by radiation.   
Explain the power of different materials.

You can feel the heat transfer from a fire and from the Sun. Similarly, you can sometimes tell that the oven is hot without touching its door or looking inside—it may just warm you as you walk by. The space between the Earth and the Sun is largely empty, without any possibility of heat transfer by convection or conduction. In these examples, heat is transferred by radiation. That is, the hot body emits electromagnetic waves that are absorbed by our skin: no medium is required for electromagnetic waves to propagate. Different names are used for electromagnetic waves of different wavelengths: radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays.

  
FIGURE 14.23 Most of the heat transfer from this fire to the observers is through infrared radiation. The visible light, although dramatic, transfers relatively little thermal energy. Convection transfers energy away from the observers as hot air rises, while conduction is negligibly slow here. Skin is very sensitive to infrared radiation, so that you can sense the presence of a fire without looking at it directly. (credit: Daniel X. O’Neil)

The energy of electromagnetic radiation depends on the wavelength (color) and varies over a wide range: a smaller wavelength (or higher frequency) corresponds to a higher energy. Because more heat is radiated at higher temperatures, a temperature change is accompanied by a color change. Take, for example, an electrical element on a stove, which glows from red to orange, while the higher-temperature steel in a blast furnace glows from yellow to white. The radiation you feel is mostly infrared, which corresponds to a lower temperature than that of the electrical element and the steel. The radiated energy depends on its intensity, which is represented in the figure below by the height of the distribution.

Electromagnetic Waves explains more about the electromagnetic spectrum and Introduction to Quantum Physics discusses how the decrease in wavelength corresponds to an increase in energy.  
FIGURE 14.24 (a) A graph of the spectra of electromagnetic waves emitted from an ideal radiator at three different temperatures. The intensity or rate of radiation emission increases dramatically with temperature, and the spectrum shifts toward the visible and ultraviolet parts of the spectrum. The shaded portion denotes the visible part of the spectrum. It is apparent that the shift toward the ultraviolet with temperature makes the visible appearance shift from red to white to blue as temperature increases. (b) Note the variations in color corresponding to variations in flame temperature. (credit: Tuohirulla)

All objects absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation. The rate of heat transfer by radiation is largely determined by the color of the object. Black is the most effective, and white is the least effective. People living in hot climates generally avoid wearing black clothing, for instance. Similarly, black asphalt in a parking lot will be hotter than adjacent gray sidewalk on a summer day, because black absorbs better than gray. The reverse is also true—black radiates better than gray. Thus, on a clear summer night, the asphalt will be colder than the gray sidewalk, because black radiates the energy more rapidly than gray. An ideal radiator is the same color as an ideal absorber, and captures all the radiation that falls on it. In contrast, white is a poor absorber and is also a poor radiator. A white object reflects all radiation, like a mirror. (A perfect, polished white surface is mirror-like in appearance, and a crushed mirror looks white.)

  
FIGURE 14.25 This illustration shows that the darker pavement is hotter than the lighter pavement (much more of the ice on the right has melted), although both have been in the sunlight for the same time. The thermal conductivities of the pavements are the same.

Gray objects have a uniform ability to absorb all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. Colored objects behave in similar but more complex ways, which gives them a particular color in the visible range and may make them special in other ranges of the nonvisible spectrum. Take, for example, the strong absorption of infrared radiation by the skin, which allows us to be very sensitive to it.  
FIGURE 14.26 A black object is a good absorber and a good radiator, while a white (or silver) object is a poor absorber and a poor radiator. It is as if radiation from the inside is reflected back into the silver object, whereas radiation from the inside of the black object is “absorbed” when it hits the surface and finds itself on the outside and is strongly emitted.

The rate of heat transfer by emitted radiation is determined by the Stefan-Boltzmann law of radiation:



where  is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant,  is the surface area of the object, and  is its absolute temperature in kelvin. The symbol  stands for the emissivity of the object, which is a measure of how well it radiates. An ideal jet-black (or black body) radiator has  , whereas a perfect reflector has  . Real objects fall between these two values. Take, for example, tungsten light bulb filaments which have an  of about , and carbon black (a material used in printer toner), which has the (greatest known) emissivity of about .

The radiation rate is directly proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature—a remarkably strong temperature dependence. Furthermore, the radiated heat is proportional to the surface area of the object. If you knock apart the coals of a fire, there is a noticeable increase in radiation due to an increase in radiating surface area.

Skin is a remarkably good absorber and emitter of infrared radiation, having an emissivity of 0.97 in the infraredspectrum. Thus, we are all nearly (jet) black in the infrared, in spite of the obvious variations in skin color. This high infrared emissivity is why we can so easily feel radiation on our skin. It is also the basis for the use of night scopes used by law enforcement and the military to detect human beings. Even small temperature variations can be detected because of the  dependence. Images, called thermographs, can be used medically to detect regions of abnormally high temperature in the body, perhaps indicative of disease. Similar techniques can be used to detect heat leaks in homes Figure 14.27, optimize performance of blast furnaces, improve comfort levels in work environments, and even remotely map the Earth’s temperature profile.

All objects emit and absorb radiation. The net rate of heat transfer by radiation (absorption minus emission) is related to both the temperature of the object and the temperature of its surroundings. Assuming that an object with a temperature  is surrounded by an environment with uniform temperature  , the net rate of heat transfer by radiation is



where  is the emissivity of the object alone. In other words, it does not matter whether the surroundings are white, gray, or black; the balance of radiation into and out of the object depends on how well it emits and absorbs radiation. When  , the quantity  is positive; that is, the net heat transfer is from hot to cold.

# Discussion

This value is a significant rate of heat transfer to the environment (note the minus sign), considering that a person at rest may produce energy at the rate of 125 W and that conduction and convection will also be transferring energy to the environment. Indeed, we would probably expect this person to feel cold. Clothing significantly reduces heat transfer to the environment by many methods, because clothing slows down both conduction and convection, and has a lower emissivity (especially if it is white) than skin.

The Earth receives almost all its energy from radiation of the Sun and reflects some of it back into outer space. Because the Sun is hotter than the Earth, the net energy flux is from the Sun to the Earth. However, the rate ofenergy transfer is less than the equation for the radiative heat transfer would predict because the Sun does not fill the sky. The average emissivity ( ) of the Earth is about 0.65, but the calculation of this value is complicated by the fact that the highly reflective cloud coverage varies greatly from day to day. There is a negative feedback (one in which a change produces an effect that opposes that change) between clouds and heat transfer; greater temperatures evaporate more water to form more clouds, which reflect more radiation back into space, reducing the temperature. The often mentioned greenhouse effect is directly related to the variation of the Earth’s emissivity with radiation type (see the figure given below). The greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon responsible for providing temperatures suitable for life on Earth. The Earth’s relatively constant temperature is a result of the energy balance between the incoming solar radiation and the energy radiated from the Earth. Most of the infrared radiation emitted from the Earth is absorbed by carbon dioxide  ) and water  in the atmosphere and then re-radiated back to the Earth or into outer space. Re-radiation back to the Earth maintains its surface temperature about  higher than it would be if there was no atmosphere, similar to the way glass increases temperatures in a greenhouse.

The greenhouse effect and its causes were first predicted by Eunice Newton Foote after she designed and conducted experiments on heating of different gases. After filling flasks with carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and regular air, then also modifying moisture, she placed them in the sun and carefully measured their heating and, especially, their heat retention. She discovered that the  flask gained the most temperature and held it the longest. After subsequent research, her paper "Circumstances affecting the Heat of the Sun’s Rays" included conclusions that an atmosphere consisting of more carbon dioxide would be hotter resulting from the gas trapping radiation.

  
FIGURE 14.28 The greenhouse effect is a name given to the trapping of energy in the Earth’s atmosphere by a process similar to that used in greenhouses. The atmosphere, like window glass, is transparent to incoming visible radiation and most of the Sun’s infrared. These wavelengths are absorbed by the Earth and re-emitted as infrared. Since Earth’s temperature is much lower than that of the Sun, the infrared radiated by the Earth has a much longer wavelength. The atmosphere, like glass, traps these longer infrared rays, keeping the Earth warmer than it would otherwise be. The amount of trapping depends on concentrations of trace gases like carbon dioxide, and a change in the concentration of these gases is believed to affect the Earth’s surface temperature.

The greenhouse effect is also central to the discussion of global warming due to emission of carbon dioxide and methane (and other so-called greenhouse gases) into the Earth’s atmosphere from industrial production and farming. Changes in global climate could lead to more intense storms, precipitation changes (affecting agriculture), reduction in rain forest biodiversity, and rising sea levels.

Heating and cooling are often significant contributors to energy use in individual homes. Mária Telkes, a Hungarianborn American scientist, was among the foremost developers of solar energy applications in industrial and community use. After inventing a widely deployed solar seawater distiller used on World War II life rafts, she partnered with architect Eleanor Raymond to design the first modern home to be completely heated by solar power. Air warmed on rooftop collectors transferred heat to salts, which stored the heat for later use. Telkes later worked with the Department of Energy to develop the first solar-electrically powered home. Current research efforts into developing environmentally friendly homes quite often focus on reducing conventional heating and cooling through better building materials, strategically positioning windows to optimize radiation gain from the Sun, and opening spaces to allow convection. It is possible to build a zero-energy house that allows for comfortable living in mostparts of the United States with hot and humid summers and cold winters.

  
FIGURE 14.29 This simple but effective solar cooker uses the greenhouse effect and reflective material to trap and retain solar energy. Made of inexpensive, durable materials, it saves money and labor, and is of particular economic value in countries with lower energy availability. Mária Telkes, a pioneering innovator in solar applications, developed some of the earliest models of these cookers in the 1950s. (credit: E.B. Kauai)

Conversely, dark space is very cold, about  , so that the Earth radiates energy into the dark sky. Owing to the fact that clouds have lower emissivity than either oceans or land masses, they reflect some of the radiation back to the surface, greatly reducing heat transfer into dark space, just as they greatly reduce heat transfer into the atmosphere during the day. The rate of heat transfer from soil and grasses can be so rapid that frost may occur on clear summer evenings, even in warm latitudes.

# Career Connection: Energy Conservation Consultation

The cost of energy is generally believed to remain very high for the foreseeable future. Thus, passive control of heat loss in both commercial and domestic housing will become increasingly important. Energy consultants measure and analyze the flow of energy into and out of houses and ensure that a healthy exchange of air is maintained inside the house. The job prospects for an energy consultant are strong.

# Problem-Solving Strategies for the Methods of Heat Transfer

1. Examine the situation to determine what type of heat transfer is involved.   
2. Identify the type(s) of heat transfer—conduction, convection, or radiation.   
3. Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns). A written list is very useful.   
4. Make a list of what is given or can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns).   
5. Solve the appropriate equation for the quantity to be determined (the unknown).   
6. For conduction, equation  is appropriate. Table 14.3 lists thermal conductivities. For convection, determine the amount of matter moved and use equation  , to calculate the heat transfer involved in the temperature change of the fluid. If a phase change accompanies convection, equation  or  is appropriate to find the heat transfer involved in the phase change. Table 14.2 lists information relevant to phase change. For radiation, equation  gives thenet heat transfer rate.

7. Insert the knowns along with their units into the appropriate equation and obtain numerical solutions complete with units.

# Section Summary

# 14.1 Heat

• Heat and work are the two distinct methods of energy transfer. Heat is energy transferred solely due to a temperature difference.   
• Any energy unit can be used for heat transfer, and the most common are kilocalorie (kcal) and joule (J). Kilocalorie is defined to be the energy needed to change the temperature of  of water between  and  .

# 14.3 Phase Change and Latent Heat

• Most substances can exist either in solid, liquid, and gas forms, which are referred to as “phases.”

• Phase changes occur at fixed temperatures for a given substance at a given pressure, and these temperatures are called boiling and freezing (or melting) points. During phase changes, heat absorbed or released is given by:  , where  is the latent heat coefficient.

# 14.4 Heat Transfer Methods

• Heat is transferred by three different methods: conduction, convection, and radiation.

# 14.5 Conduction

• Heat conduction is the transfer of heat between two objects in direct contact with each other.   
The rate of heat transfer  (energy per unit time) is proportional to the temperature difference  and the contact area  and inversely proportional to the distance  between the objects: 

# 14.6 Convection

• Convection is heat transfer by the macroscopicmovement of mass. Convection can be natural or forced and generally transfers thermal energy faster than conduction. Table 14.4 gives wind-chill factors, indicating that moving air has the same chilling effect of much colder stationary air. Convection that occurs along with a phase change can transfer energy from cold regions to warm ones.

# 14.7 Radiation

• Radiation is the rate of heat transfer through the emission or absorption of electromagnetic waves. The rate of heat transfer depends on the surface area and the fourth power of the absolute temperature:
