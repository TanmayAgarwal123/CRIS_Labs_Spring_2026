INTRODUCTION TO ONE-DIMENSIONAL KINEMATICS Objects are in motion everywhere we look. Everything from a tennis game to a space-probe flyby of the planet Neptune involves motion. When you are resting, your heart moves blood through your veins. And even in inanimate objects, there is continuous motion in the vibrations of atoms and molecules. Questions about motion are interesting in and of themselves: How long will it take for a space also key to understanding other concepts in physics. An understanding of acceleration, for example, is crucial to the study of force.

Our formal study of physics begins with kinematics which is defined as the study of motion without considering its c.e worac o Gree o nela g or as “cinema” (movies) and “kinesiology” (the study of human motion). In one-dimensional kinematics and TwoDimensional Kinematics we will study only the motion of a football, for example, without worrying about what forces cause or change its motion. Such considerations come in other chapters. In this chapter, we examine the simplesttype of motion—namely, motion along a straight line, or one-dimensional motion. In Two-Dimensional Kinematics, we apply concepts developed here to study motion along curved paths (two- and three-dimensional motion); for example, that of a car rounding a curve.

# 2.1 Displacement

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Define position, displacement, distance, and distance traveled.   
Explain the relationship between position and displacement.   
Distinguish between displacement and distance traveled.   
Calculate displacement and distance given initial position, final position, and the path between the two.

# Position

In order to describe the motion of an object, you must first be able to describe its position—where it is at any particular time. More precisely, you need to specify its position relative to a convenient reference frame. Earth is often used as a reference frame, and we often describe the position of an object as it relates to stationary objects in that reference frame. For example, a rocket launch would be described in terms of the position of the rocket with respect to the Earth as a whole, while a professor’s position could be described in terms of where she is in relation to the nearby white board. (See Figure 2.3.) In other cases, we use reference frames that are not stationary but are in motion relative to the Earth. To describe the position of a person in an airplane, for example, we use the airplane, not the Earth, as the reference frame. (See Figure 2.4.)

# Displacement

If an object moves relative to a reference frame (for example, if a professor moves to the right relative to a white board or a passenger moves toward the rear of an airplane), then the object’s position changes. This change in position is known as displacement. The word “displacement” implies that an object has moved, or has been displaced.

# Displacement

Displacement is the change in position of an object:



where  is displacement,  is the final position, and  is the initial position.In this text the upper case Greek letter  (delta) always means “change in” whatever quantity follows it; thus,  means change in position. Always solve for displacement by subtracting initial position  from final position  .

Note that the SI unit for displacement is the meter  (see Physical Quantities and Units), but sometimes kilometers, miles, feet, and other units of length are used. Keep in mind that when units other than the meter are used in a problem, you may need to convert them into meters to complete the calculation.

  
FIGURE 2.3 A professor paces left and right while lecturing. Her position relative to Earth is given by  . The  displacement of the professor relative to Earth is represented by an arrow pointing to the right.

  
FIGURE  passenger moves from his seat to the back of the plane. His location relative to the airplane is given by  . The  displacement of the passenger relative to the plane is represented by an arrow toward the rear of the plane. Notice that the arrow representing his displacement is twice as long as the arrow representing the displacement of the professor (he moves twice as far) in Figure 2.3.

Note that displacement has a direction as well as a magnitude. The professor’s displacement is  to the right, and the airline passenger’s displacement is  toward the rear. In one-dimensional motion, direction can be specified with a plus or minus sign. When you begin a problem, you should select which direction is positive (usually that will be to the right or up, but you are free to select positive as being any direction). The professor’s initial position is  and her final position is  . Thus her displacement is

In this coordinate system, motion to the right is positive, whereas motion to the left is negative. Similarly, the airplane passenger’s initial position is  and his final position is  , so his displacement is



His displacement is negative because his motion is toward the rear of the plane, or in the negative  direction in our coordinate system.

# Distance

Although displacement is described in terms of direction, distance is not. Distance is defined to be the magnitude or l e poisoa taeo posio m distance traveled between them. Distance traveled is the total length of the path traveled between two positions. Distance has no direction and, thus, no sign. For example, the distance the professor walks is  . The distance the airplane passenger walks is  .

# Misconception Alert: Distance Traveled vs. Magnitude of Displacement

It is important to note that the distance traveled, however, can be greater than the magnitude of the displacement (by magnitude, we mean just the size of the displacement without regard to its direction; that is, just a number with a unit). For example, the professor could pace back and forth many times, perhaps walking a distance of  during a lecture, yet still end up only  to the right of her starting point. In this case her displacement would be  , the magnitude of her displacement would be  , but the distance she traveled would be  . In kinematics we nearly always deal with displacement and magnitude of displacement, and almost never with distance traveled. One way to think about this is to assume you marked the start of the motion and the end of the motion. The displacement is simply the difference in the position of the two marks and is independent of the path taken in traveling between the two marks. The distance traveled, however, is the total length of the path taken between the two marks.

# 2.2 Vectors, Scalars, and Coordinate Systems

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Define and distinguish between scalar and vector quantities.   
Assign a coordinate system for a scenario involving one-dimensional motion.  
FIGURE 2.6 The motion of this Eclipse Concept jet can be described in terms of the distance it has traveled (a scalar quantity) or its displacement in a specific direction (a vector quantity). In order to specify the direction of motion, its displacement must be described based on a coordinate system. In this case, it may be convenient to choose motion toward the left as positive motion (it is the forward direction for the plane), although in many cases, the  -coordinate runs from left to right, with motion to the right as positive and motion to the left as negative. (credit: Armchair Aviator, Flickr)

What is the difference between distance and displacement? Whereas displacement is defined by both direction and magnitude, distance is defined only by magnitude. Displacement is an example of a vector quantity. Distance is an example of a scalar quantity. A vector is any quantity with both magnitude and direction. Other examples of vectors include a velocity of  /h east and a force of 500 newtons straight down.

The direction of a vector in one-dimensional motion is given simply by a plus  or minus  sign. Vectors are represented graphically by arrows. An arrow used to represent a vector has a length proportional to the vector’s magnitude (e.g., the larger the magnitude, the longer the length of the vector) and points in the same direction as the vector.

Some physical quantities, like distance, either have no direction or none is specified. A scalar is any quantity that has a magnitude, but no direction. For example, a  temperature, the 250 kilocalories (250 Calories) of energy in a candy bar, a  speed limit, a person’s  height, and a distance of  are all scalars—quantities with no specified direction. Note, however, that a scalar can be negative, such as a  temperature. In this case, the minus sign indicates a point on a scale rather than a direction. Scalars are never represented by arrows.

# Coordinate Systems for One-Dimensional Motion

In order to describe the direction of a vector quantity, you must designate a coordinate system within the reference frame. For one-dimensional motion, this is a simple coordinate system consisting of a one-dimensional coordinate line. In general, when describing horizontal motion, motion to the right is usually considered positive, and motion to the left is considered negative. With vertical motion, motion up is usually positive and motion down is negative. In some cases, however, as with the jet in Figure 2.6, it can be more convenient to switch the positive and negative directions. For example, if you are analyzing the motion of falling objects, it can be useful to define downwards as the positive direction. If people in a race are running to the left, it is useful to define left as the positive direction. It does not matter as long as the system is clear and consistent. Once you assign a positive direction and start solving a problem, you cannot change it.  
FIGURE 2.7 It is usually convenient to consider motion upward or to the right as positive  and motion downward or to the left as negative  .

# CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING

A person’s speed can stay the same as they round a corner and changes direction. Given this information, is speed a scalar or a vector quantity? Explain.

# Solution

Speed is a scalar quantity. It does not change at all with direction changes; therefore, it has magnitude only. If it were a vector quantity, it would change as direction changes (even if its magnitude remained constant).

# 2.3 Time, Velocity, and Speed

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Explain the relationships between instantaneous velocity, average velocity, instantaneous speed, average speed, displacement, and time.   
Calculate velocity and speed given initial position, initial time, final position, and final time.   
Derive a graph of velocity vs. time given a graph of position vs. time.   
Interpret a graph of velocity vs. time.

  
FIGURE 2.8 The motion of these racing snails can be described by their speeds and their velocities. (credit: tobitasflickr, Flickr)

There is more to motion than distance and displacement. Questions such as, “How long does a foot race take?” and “What was the runner’s speed?” cannot be answered without an understanding of other concepts. In this section we add definitions of time, velocity, and speed to expand our description of motion.

# Time

As discussed in Physical Quantities and Units, the most fundamental physical quantities are defined by how they are measured. This is the case with time. Every measurement of time involves measuring a change in some physical quantity. It may be a number on a digital clock, a heartbeat, or the position of the Sun in the sky. In physics, the definition of time is simple—time is change, or the interval over which change occurs. It is impossible to know thattime has passed unless something changes.

The amount of time or change is calibrated by comparison with a standard. The SI unit for time is the second, abbreviated s. We might, for example, observe that a certain pendulum makes one full swing every  . We could then use the pendulum to measure time by counting its swings or, of course, by connecting the pendulum to a clock mechanism that registers time on a dial. This allows us to not only measure the amount of time, but also to determine a sequence of events.

How does time relate to motion? We are usually interested in elapsed time for a particular motion, such as how long it takes an airplane passenger to get from his seat to the back of the plane. To find elapsed time, we note the time at the beginning and end of the motion and subtract the two. For example, a lecture may start at 11:00 A.M. and end at 11:50 A.M., so that the elapsed time would be 50 min. Elapsed time  is the difference between the ending time and beginning time,



where  is the change in time or elapsed time,  is the time at the end of the motion, and  is the time at the beginning of the motion. (As usual, the delta symbol,  , means the change in the quantity that follows it.)

Life is simpler if the beginning time  is taken to be zero, as when we use a stopwatch. If we were using a stopwatch, it would simply read zero at the start of the lecture and  at the end. If  , then  .

In this text, for simplicity’s sake,

• motion starts at time equal to zero  • the symbol  is used for elapsed time unless otherwise specified  b

# Velocity

Your notion of velocity is probably the same as its scientific definition. You know that if you have a large displacement in a small amount of time you have a large velocity, and that velocity has units of distance divided by time, such as miles per hour or kilometers per hour.

# Average Velocity

Average velocity is displacement (change in position) divided by the time of travel,



where  is the average (indicated by the bar over the  ) velocity,  is the change in position (or displacement), and  and  are the final and beginning positions at times  and  , respectively. If the starting time  is taken to be zero, then the average velocity is simply



Notice that this definition indicates that velocity is a vector because displacement is a vector. It has both magnitude and direction. The SI unit for velocity is meters per second or  , but many other units, such as  (also written as mph), and  , are in common use. Suppose, for example, an airplane passenger took 5 seconds to move  (the negative sign indicates that displacement is toward the back of the plane). His average velocity would be



The minus sign indicates the average velocity is also toward the rear of the plane.

The average velocity of an object does not tell us anything about what happens to it between the starting point and ending point, however. For example, we cannot tell from average velocity whether the airplane passenger stops momentarily or backs up before he goes to the back of the plane. To get more details, we must consider smallersegments of the trip over smaller time intervals.

  
FIGURE 2.9 A more detailed record of an airplane passenger heading toward the back of the plane, showing smaller segments of his trip.

The smaller the time intervals considered in a motion, the more detailed the information. When we carry this process to its logical conclusion, we are left with an infinitesimally small interval. Over such an interval, the average velocity becomes the instantaneous velocity or the velocity at a specific instant. A car’s speedometer, for example, shows the magnitude (but not the direction) of the instantaneous velocity of the car. (Police give tickets based on instantaneous velocity, but when calculating how long it will take to get from one place to another on a road trip, you need to use average velocity.) Instantaneous velocity  is the average velocity at a specific instant in time (or over an infinitesimally small time interval).

Mathematically, finding instantaneous velocity,  , at a precise instant can involve taking a limit, a calculus operation beyond the scope of this text. However, under many circumstances, we can find precise values for instantaneous velocity without calculus.

# Speed

In everyday language, most people use the terms “speed” and “velocity” interchangeably. In physics, however, they do not have the same meaning and they are distinct concepts. One major difference is that speed has no direction. Thus speed is a scalar. Just as we need to distinguish between instantaneous velocity and average velocity, we also need to distinguish between instantaneous speed and average speed.

Instantaneous speed is the magnitude of instantaneous velocity. For example, suppose the airplane passenger at one instant had an instantaneous velocity of  (the minus meaning toward the rear of the plane). At that same time his instantaneous speed was  . Or suppose that at one time during a shopping trip your instantaneous velocity is  due north. Your instantaneous speed at that instant would be  /h—the same magnitude but without a direction. Average speed, however, is very different from average velocity. Average speed is the distance traveled divided by elapsed time.

We have noted that distance traveled can be greater than the magnitude of displacement. So average speed can be greater than average velocity, which is displacement divided by time. For example, if you drive to a store and return home in half an hour, and your car’s odometer shows the total distance traveled was  , then your average speed was  . Your average velocity, however, was zero, because your displacement for the round trip is zero. (Displacement is change in position and, thus, is zero for a round trip.) Thus average speed is not simply the magnitude of average velocity.  
FIGURE 2.10 During a 30-minute round trip to the store, the total distance traveled is  . The average speed is  . The displacement for the round trip is zero, since there was no net change in position. Thus the average velocity is zero.

Another way of visualizing the motion of an object is to use a graph. A plot of position or of velocity as a function of time can be very useful. For example, for this trip to the store, the position, velocity, and speed-vs.-time graphs are displayed in Figure 2.11. (Note that these graphs depict a very simplified model of the trip. We are assuming that speed is constant during the trip, which is unrealistic given that we’ll probably stop at the store. But for simplicity’s sake, we will model it with no stops or changes in speed. We are also assuming that the route between the store and the house is a perfectly straight line.)  
FIGURE 2.11 Position vs. time, velocity vs. time, and speed vs. time on a trip. Note that the velocity for the return trip is negative.

# Making Connections: Take-Home Investigation—Getting a Sense of Speed

If you have spent much time driving, you probably have a good sense of speeds between about 10 and 70 miles per hour. But what are these in meters per second? What do we mean when we say that something is moving at  To get a better sense of what these values really mean, do some observations and calculations on your own:

• calculate typical car speeds in meters per second • estimate jogging and walking speed by timing yourself; convert the measurements into both m/s and mi/h• determine the speed of an ant, snail, or falling leaf

# Solution

(a) The average velocity of the train is zero because  ; the train ends up at the same place it starts.

(b) The average speed of the train is calculated below. Note that the train travels 40 miles one way and 40 miles back, for a total distance of 80 miles.





# 2.4 Acceleration

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Define and distinguish between instantaneous acceleration, average acceleration, and deceleration.   
• Calculate acceleration given initial time, initial velocity, final time, and final velocity.

  
FIGURE 2.12 A plane decelerates, or slows down, as it comes in for landing in St. Maarten. Its acceleration is opposite in direction to its velocity. (credit: Steve Conry, Flickr)

In everyday conversation, to accelerate means to speed up. The accelerator in a car can in fact cause it to speed up. The greater the acceleration, the greater the change in velocity over a given time. The formal definition of acceleration is consistent with these notions, but more inclusive.

# Average Acceleration

Average Acceleration is the rate at which velocity changes,



where  is average acceleration,  is velocity, and  is time. (The bar over the  means average acceleration.)

Because acceleration is velocity in  divided by time in s, the SI units for acceleration are  , meters per second squared or meters per second per second, which literally means by how many meters per second the velocity changes every second.Recall that velocity is a vector—it has both magnitude and direction. This means that a change in velocity can be a change in magnitude (or speed), but it can also be a change in direction. For example, if a car turns a corner at constant speed, it is accelerating because its direction is changing. The quicker you turn, the greater the acceleration. So there is an acceleration when velocity changes either in magnitude (an increase or decrease in speed) or in direction, or both.

# Acceleration as a Vector

Acceleration is a vector in the same direction as the change in velocity,  . Since velocity is a vector, it can change either in magnitude or in direction. Acceleration is therefore a change in either speed or direction, or both.

Keep in mind that although acceleration is in the direction of the change in velocity, it is not always in the direction of Wh wat deceleration.

  
FIGURE 2.13 A subway train in Sao Paulo, Brazil, decelerates as it comes into a station. It is accelerating in a direction opposite to its direction of motion. (credit: Yusuke Kawasaki, Flickr)

# Misconception Alert: Deceleration vs. Negative Acceleration

Deceleration always refers to acceleration in the direction opposite to the direction of the velocity. Deceleration always reduces speed. Negative acceleration, however, is acceleration in the negative direction in the chosen coordinate syste Negative acceleration may or may not be deceleratin, and deceleration may o may ot be considered negative acceleration. For example, consider Figure 2.14.  
FIGURE 2.14 (a) This car is speeding up as it moves toward the right. It therefore has positive acceleration in our coordinate system. (b) This car is slowing down as it moves toward the right. Therefore, it has negative acceleration in our coordinate system, because its acceleration is toward the left. The car is also decelerating: the direction of its acceleration is opposite to its direction of motion. (c) This car is moving toward the left, but slowing down over time. Therefore, its acceleration is positive in our coordinate system because it is toward the right. However, the car is decelerating because its acceleration is opposite to its motion. (d) This car is speeding up as it moves toward the left. It has negative acceleration because it is accelerating toward the left. However, because its acceleration is in the same direction as its motion, it is speeding up (not decelerating).

# EXAMPLE 2.1

# Calculating Acceleration: A Racehorse Leaves the Gate

A racehorse coming out of the gate accelerates from rest to a velocity of  due west in 1.80 s. What is its average acceleration?  
FIGURE 2.15 (credit: Jon Sullivan, PD Photo.org)

# Strategy

First we draw a sketch and assign a coordinate system to the problem. This is a simple problem, but it always helps to visualize it. Notice that we assign east as positive and west as negative. Thus, in this case, we have negative velocity.

  
FIGURE 2.16

We can solve this problem by identifying  and  from the given information and then calculating the average acceleration directly from the equation 

# Solution

1. Identify the knowns.  ,  (the negative sign indicates direction toward the west),  .

2. Find the change in velocity. Since the horse is going from zero to  , its change in velocity equals its final velocity:  .

3. Plug in the known values  and  ) and solve for the unknown  .



# Discussion

The negative sign for acceleration indicates that acceleration is toward the west. An acceleration of  due west means that the horse increases its velocity by  due west each second, that is, 8.33 meters per second per second, which we write as  . This is truly an average acceleration, because the ride is not smooth. We shall see later that an acceleration of this magnitude would require the rider to hang on with a force nearly equal to his weight.# Instantaneous Acceleration

Instantaneous acceleration  , or the acceleration at a specific instant in time, is obtained by the same process as discussed for instantaneous velocity in Time, Velocity, and Speed—that is, by considering an infinitesimally small interval of time. How do we find instantaneous acceleration using only algebra? The answer is that we choose an average acceleration that is representative of the motion. Figure 2.17 shows graphs of instantaneous acceleration versus time for two very different motions. In Figure 2.17(a), the acceleration varies slightly and the average over the entire interval is nearly the same as the instantaneous acceleration at any time. In this case, we should treat this motion as if it had a constant acceleration equal to the average (in this case about  ). In Figure 2.17(b), the acceleration varies drastically over time. In such situations it is best to consider smaller time intervals and choose an average acceleration for each. For example, we could consider motion over the time intervals from 0 to 1.0 s and from 1.0 to 3.0 s as separate motions with accelerations of  and  , respectively.

  
FIGURE 2.17 Graphs of instantaneous acceleration versus time for two different one-dimensional motions. (a) Here acceleration varies only slightly and is always in the same direction, since it is positive. The average over the interval is nearly the same as the acceleration at any given time. (b) Here the acceleration varies greatly, perhaps representing a package on a post office conveyor belt that is accelerated forward and backward as it bumps along. It is necessary to consider small time intervals (such as from 0 to 1.0 s) with constant or nearly constant acceleration in such a situation.

The next several examples consider the motion of the subway train shown in Figure 2.18. In (a) the shuttle moves to the right, and in (b) it moves to the left. The examples are designed to further illustrate aspects of motion and to illustrate some of the reasoning that goes into solving problems.  
FIGURE 2.18 One-dimensional motion of a subway train considered in Example 2.2, Example 2.3, Example 2.4, Example 2.5, Example 2.6, and Example 2.7. Here we have chosen the  -axis so that  means to the right and means to the left for displacements, velocities, and accelerations. (a) The subway train moves to the right from  to  . Its displacement  is  . (b) The train moves to the left from  to  . Its displacement  is  . (Note that the prime symbol (′) is used simply to distinguish between displacement in the two different situations. The distances of travel and the size of the cars are on different scales to fit everything into the diagram.)

# EXAMPLE 2.2

# Calculating Displacement: A Subway Train

What are the magnitude and sign of displacements for the motions of the subway train shown in parts (a) and (b) of Figure 2.18?

# Strategy

A drawing with a coordinate system is already provided, so we don’t need to make a sketch, but we should analyze it to make sure we understand what it is showing. Pay particular attention to the coordinate system. To find displacement, we use the equation  . This is straightforward since the initial and final positions are given.

# Solution

1. Identify the knowns. In the figure we see that  and  for part (a), and  and  for part (b).

2. Solve for displacement in part (a).



3. Solve for displacement in part (b).



# Discussion

The direction of the motion in (a) is to the right and therefore its displacement has a positive sign, whereas motion in (b) is to the left and thus has a negative sign.# EXAMPLE 2.3

# Comparing Distance Traveled with Displacement: A Subway Train

What are the distances traveled for the motions shown in parts (a) and (b) of the subway train in Figure 2.18?

# Strategy

To answer this question, think about the definitions of distance and distance traveled, and how they are related to displacement. Distance between two positions is defined to be the magnitude of displacement, which was found in Example 2.2. Distance traveled is the total length of the path traveled between the two positions. (See Displacement.) In the case of the subway train shown in Figure 2.18, the distance traveled is the same as the distance between the initial and final positions of the train.

# Solution

1. The displacement for part (a) was  km. Therefore, the distance between the initial and final positions was  , and the distance traveled was  .   
2. The displacement for part (b) was  Therefore, the distance between the initial and final positions was  , and the distance traveled was  .

# Discussion

Distance is a scalar. It has magnitude but no sign to indicate direction.

# EXAMPLE 2.4

# Calculating Acceleration: A Subway Train Speeding Up

Suppose the train in Figure 2.18(a) accelerates from rest to  in the first 20.0 s of its motion. What is its average acceleration during that time interval?

# Strategy

It is worth it at this point to make a simple sketch:

  
FIGURE 2.19

This problem involves three steps. First we must determine the change in velocity, then we must determine the change in time, and finally we use these values to calculate the acceleration.

# Solution

1. Identify the knowns.  (the trains starts at rest),  , and  .   
2. Calculate  . Since the train starts from rest, its change in velocity is  , where the plus sign means velocity to the right.   
3. Plug in known values and solve for the unknown,  .

4. Since the units are mixed (we have both hours and seconds for time), we need to convert everything into SI units of meters and seconds. (See Physical Quantities and Units for more guidance.)



# Discussion

The plus sign means that acceleration is to the right. This is reasonable because the train starts from rest and ends up with a velocity to the right (also positive). So acceleration is in the same direction as the change in velocity, as is always the case.

# EXAMPLE 2.5

# Calculate Acceleration: A Subway Train Slowing Down

Now suppose that at the end of its trip, the train in Figure 2.18(a) slows to a stop from a speed of  in 8.00 s. What is its average acceleration while stopping?

# Strategy

  
FIGURE 2.20

In this case, the train is decelerating and its acceleration is negative because it is toward the left. As in the previous example, we must find the change in velocity and the change in time and then solve for acceleration.

# Solution

1. Identify the knowns.  ,  (the train is stopped, so its velocity is 0), and  .

2. Solve for the change in velocity,  .



3. Plug in the knowns,  and  , and solve for  .



4. Convert the units to meters and seconds.



# Discussion

The minus sign indicates that acceleration is to the left. This sign is reasonable because the train initially has a positive velocity in this problem, and a negative acceleration would oppose the motion. Again, acceleration is in the same direction as the change in velocity, which is negative here. This acceleration can be called a deceleration because it has a direction opposite to the velocity.The graphs of position, velocity, and acceleration vs. time for the trains in Example 2.4 and Example 2.5 are displayed in Figure 2.21. (We have taken the velocity to remain constant from 20 to 40 s, after which the train decelerates.)

  
FIGURE 2.21 (a) Position of the train over time. Notice that the train’s position changes slowly at the beginning of the journey, then more and more quickly as it picks up speed. Its position then changes more slowly as it slows down at the end of the journey. In the middle of the journey, while the velocity remains constant, the position changes at a constant rate. (b) Velocity of the train over time. The train’s velocity increases as it accelerates at the beginning of the journey. It remains the same in the middle of the journey (where there is no acceleration). It decreases as the train decelerates at the end of the journey. (c) The acceleration of the train over time. The train has positive acceleration as it speeds up at the beginning of the journey. It has no acceleration as it travels at constant velocity in the middle of the journey. Its acceleration is negative as it slows down at the end of the journey.# EXAMPLE 2.6

# Calculating Average Velocity: The Subway Train

What is the average velocity of the train in part b of Example 2.2, and shown again below, if it takes 5.00 min to make its trip?

  
FIGURE 2.22

# Strategy

Average velocity is displacement divided by time. It will be negative here, since the train moves to the left and has a negative displacement.

# Solution

1. Identify the knowns.  ,  , 

2. Determine displacement,  . We found  to be  in Example 2.2.

3. Solve for average velocity.



4. Convert units.



# Discussion

The negative velocity indicates motion to the left.

# EXAMPLE 2.7

# Calculating Deceleration: The Subway Train

Finally, suppose the train in Figure 2.22 slows to a stop from a velocity of  in 10.0 s. What is its average acceleration?

# Strategy

Once again, let’s draw a sketch:  
FIGURE 2.23

As before, we must find the change in velocity and the change in time to calculate average acceleration.

# Solution

1. Identify the knowns.  ,  ,  .

2. Calculate  . The change in velocity here is actually positive, since



3. Solve for 



4. Convert units.



# Discussion

The plus sign means that acceleration is to the right. This is reasonable because the train initially has a negative velocity (to the left) in this problem and a positive acceleration opposes the motion (and so it is to the right). Again, acceleration is in the same direction as the change in velocity, which is positive here. As in Example 2.5, this acceleration can be called a deceleration since it is in the direction opposite to the velocity.

# Sign and Direction

Perhaps the most important thing to note about these examples is the signs of the answers. In our chosen coordinate system, plus means the quantity is to the right and minus means it is to the left. This is easy to imagine for displacement and velocity. But it is a little less obvious for acceleration. Most people interpret negative acceleration as the slowing of an object. This was not the case in Example 2.7, where a positive acceleration slowed a negative velocity. The crucial distinction was that the acceleration was in the opposite direction from the velocity. In fact, a negative acceleration will increase a negative velocity. For example, the train moving to the left in Figure 2.22 is sped up by an acceleration to the left. In that case, both  and are negative. The plus and minus signs give the directions of the accelerations. If acceleration has the same sign as the velocity, the object is speeding up. If acceleration has the opposite sign as the velocity, the object is slowing down.



# CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING

An airplane lands on a runway traveling east. Describe its acceleration.

# Solution

If we take east to be positive, then the airplane has negative acceleration, as it is accelerating toward the west. It is also decelerating: its acceleration is opposite in direction to its velocity.# PHET EXPLORATIONS

# 2.5 Motion Equations for Constant Acceleration in One Dimension

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Calculate displacement of an object that is not accelerating, given initial position and velocity. Calculate final velocity of an accelerating object, given initial velocity, acceleration, and time. Calculate displacement and final position of an accelerating object, given initial position, initial velocity, time, and acceleration.

  
FIGURE 2.24 Kinematic equations can help us describe and predict the motion of moving objects such as these kayaks racing in Newbury, England. (credit: Barry Skeates, Flickr)

We might know that the greater the acceleration of, say, a car moving away from a stop sign, the greater the displacement in a given time. But we have not developed a specific equation that relates acceleration and displacement. In this section, we develop some convenient equations for kinematic relationships, starting from the definitions of displacement, velocity, and acceleration already covered.

# Notation: 

First, let us make some simplifications in notation. Taking the initial time to be zero, as if time is measured with a stopwatch, is a great simplification. Since elapsed time is  , taking  means that  , the final time on the stopwatch. When initial time is taken to be zero, we use the subscript 0 to denote initial values of position and velocity. That is,  is the initial position and  is the initial velocity. We put no subscripts on the final values. That is,  is the final time,  is the final position, and  is the final velocity. This gives a simpler expression for elapsed time—now,  . It also simplifies the expression for displacement, which is now  . Also, it simplifies the expression for change in velocity, which is now  . To summarize, using the simplified notation, with the initial time taken to be zero,



where the subscript 0 denotes an initial value and the absence of a subscript denotes a final value in whatever motion is under consideration.We now make the important assumption that acceleration is constant. This assumption allows us to avoid using calculus to find instantaneous acceleration. Since acceleration is constant, the average and instantaneous accelerations are equal. That is,



so we use the symbol for acceleration at all times. Assuming acceleration to be constant does not seriously limit the situations we can study nor degrade the accuracy of our treatment. For one thing, acceleration is constant in a great number of situations. Furthermore, in many other situations we can accurately describe motion by assuming a constant acceleration equal to the average acceleration for that motion. Finally, in motions where acceleration changes drastically, such as a car accelerating to top speed and then braking to a stop, the motion can be considered in separate parts, each of which has its own constant acceleration.

# Solving for Displacement  and Final Position  from Average Velocity when Acceleration ( ) is Constant

To get our first two new equations, we start with the definition of average velocity:



Substituting the simplified notation for  and  yields



Solving for  yields



where the average velocity is



The equation  reflects the fact that, when acceleration is constant,  is just the simple average of the initial and final velocities. For example, if you steadily increase your velocity (that is, with constant acceleration) from 30 to  , then your average velocity during this steady increase is  . Using the equation  to check this, we see that



which seems logical.

# EXAMPLE 2.8

# Calculating Displacement: How Far does the Jogger Run?

A jogger runs down a straight stretch of road with an average velocity of  for 2.00 min. What is his final position, taking his initial position to be zero?

# Strategy

Draw a sketch.  
FIGURE 2.25

The final position  is given by the equation



To find  , we identify the values of  ,  , and  from the statement of the problem and substitute them into the equation.

# Solution

1. Identify the knowns.  ,  , and  .

2. Enter the known values into the equation.



# Discussion

Velocity and final displacement are both positive, which means they are in the same direction.

The equation  gives insight into the relationship between displacement, average velocity, and time. It shows, for example, that displacement is a linear function of average velocity. (By linear function, we mean that displacement depends on  rather than on  raised to some other power, such as  . When graphed, linear functions look like straight lines with a constant slope.) On a car trip, for example, we will get twice as far in a given time if we average  than if we average  .

  
FIGURE 2.26 There is a linear relationship between displacement and average velocity. For a given time , an object moving twice as fast as another object will move twice as far as the other object.

# Solving for Final Velocity

We can derive another useful equation by manipulating the definition of acceleration.

Substituting the simplified notation for  and  gives us



Solving for  yields



# EXAMPLE 2.9

# Calculating Final Velocity: An Airplane Slowing Down after Landing

An airplane lands with an initial velocity of  and then decelerates at  for  . What is its final velocity?

# Strategy

Draw a sketch. We draw the acceleration vector in the direction opposite the velocity vector because the plane is decelerating.

  
FIGURE 2.27

# Solution

1. Identify the knowns.  ,  ,  .

2. Identify the unknown. In this case, it is final velocity,  .

3. Determine which equation to use. We can calculate the final velocity using the equation  .

4. Plug in the known values and solve.



# Discussion

The final velocity is much less than the initial velocity, as desired when slowing down, but still positive. With jet engines, reverse thrust could be maintained long enough to stop the plane and start moving it backward. That would be indicated by a negative final velocity, which is not the case here.

  
FIGURE 2.28 The airplane lands with an initial velocity of  and slows to a final velocity of  before heading for the terminal.In addition to being useful in problem solving, the equation  gives us insight into the relationships among velocity, acceleration, and time. From it we can see, for example, that

• final velocity depends on how large the acceleration is and how long it lasts   
• if the acceleration is zero, then the final velocity equals the initial velocity  , as expected (i.e., velocity is constant)   
• if is negative, then the final velocity is less than the initial velocity

(All of these observations fit our intuition, and it is always useful to examine basic equations in light of our intuition and experiences to check that they do indeed describe nature accurately.)

# Making Connections: Real-World Connection

  
FIGURE 2.29 The Space Shuttle Endeavor blasts off from the Kennedy Space Center in February 2010. (credit: Matthew Simantov, Flickr)

An intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) has a larger average acceleration than the Space Shuttle and achieves a greater velocity in the first minute or two of flight (actual ICBM burn times are classified—short-burntime missiles are more difficult for an enemy to destroy). But the Space Shuttle obtains a greater final velocity, so that it can orbit the earth rather than come directly back down as an ICBM does. The Space Shuttle does this by accelerating for a longer time.

# Solving for Final Position When Velocity is Not Constant  )

We can combine the equations above to find a third equation that allows us to calculate the final position of an object experiencing constant acceleration. We start with



Adding  to each side of this equation and dividing by 2 gives



Since  for constant acceleration, then



Now we substitute this expression for  into the equation for displacement,  , yielding

# EXAMPLE 2.10

# Calculating Displacement of an Accelerating Object: Dragsters

Dragsters can achieve average accelerations of  . Suppose such a dragster accelerates from rest at this rate for 5.56 s. How far does it travel in this time?

# Strategy

Draw a sketch.

  
FIGURE 2.31

We are asked to find displacement, which is  if we take  to be zero. (Think about it like the starting line of a race. It can be anywhere, but we call it 0 and measure all other positions relative to it.) We can use the equation  once we identify  ,  , and  from the statement of the problem.

# Solution

1. Identify the knowns. Starting from rest means that  ,  is given as  and  is given as 5.56 s.

2. Plug the known values into the equation to solve for the unknown  :



Since the initial position and velocity are both zero, this simplifies to



Substituting the identified values of  and  gives



yielding

# Discussion

If we convert  to miles, we find that the distance covered is very close to one quarter of a mile, the standard distance for drag racing. So the answer is reasonable. This is an impressive displacement in only  , but topnotch dragsters can do a quarter mile in even less time than this.

What else can we learn by examining the equation  We see that:

• displacement depends on the square of the elapsed time when acceleration is not zero. In Example 2.10, the dragster covers only one fourth of the total distance in the first half of the elapsed time • if acceleration is zero, then the initial velocity equals average velocity  and  becomes 

# Solving for Final Velocity when Velocity Is Not Constant  )

A fourth useful equation can be obtained from another algebraic manipulation of previous equations.

If we solve  for  , we get



Substituting this and  into  , we get



# EXAMPLE 2.11

# Calculating Final Velocity: Dragsters

Calculate the final velocity of the dragster in Example 2.10 without using information about time.

# Strategy

Draw a sketch.

  
FIGURE 2.32

The equation  is ideally suited to this task because it relates velocities, acceleration, and displacement, and no time information is required.

# Solution

1. Identify the known values. We know that  , since the dragster starts from rest. Then we note that  (this was the answer in Example 2.10). Finally, the average acceleration was given to be  .

2. Plug the knowns into the equation  and solve for 

Thus



To get  , we take the square root:



# Discussion

 is about  or about  , but even this breakneck speed is short of the record for the quarter mile. Also, note that a square root has two values; we took the positive value to indicate a velocity in the same direction as the acceleration.

An examination of the equation  can produce further insights into the general relationships among physical quantities:

The final velocity depends on how large the acceleration is and the distance over which it acts • For a fixed deceleration, a car that is going twice as fast doesn’t simply stop in twice the distance—it takes much further to stop. (This is why we have reduced speed zones near schools.)

# Putting Equations Together

In the following examples, we further explore one-dimensional motion, but in situations requiring slightly more algebraic manipulation. The examples also give insight into problem-solving techniques. The box below provides easy reference to the equations needed.

# EXAMPLE 2.12

# Calculating Displacement: How Far Does a Car Go When Coming to a Halt?

On dry concrete, a car can decelerate at a rate of  , whereas on wet concrete it can decelerate at only  . Find the distances necessary to stop a car moving at  (about  (a) on dry concrete and (b) on wet concrete. (c) Repeat both calculations, finding the displacement from the point where the driver sees a traffic light turn red, taking into account his reaction time of 0.500 s to get his foot on the brake.

# Strategy

Draw a sketch.  
FIGURE 2.33

In order to determine which equations are best to use, we need to list all of the known values and identify exactly what we need to solve for. We shall do this explicitly in the next several examples, using tables to set them off.

# Solution for (a)

1. Identify the knowns and what we want to solve for. We know that  ;  ;  (  is negative because it is in a direction opposite to velocity). We take  to be 0. We are looking for displacement  , or  .

2. Identify the equation that will help up solve the problem. The best equation to use is



This equation is best because it includes only one unknown,  . We know the values of all the other variables in this equation. (There are other equations that would allow us to solve for  , but they require us to know the stopping time,  , which we do not know. We could use them but it would entail additional calculations.)

3. Rearrange the equation to solve for  .



4. Enter known values.



Thus,

# Solution for (b)

This part can be solved in exactly the same manner as Part A. The only difference is that the deceleration is  . The result is

# Solution for (c)

Once the driver reacts, the stopping distance is the same as it is in Parts A and B for dry and wet concrete. So to answer this question, we need to calculate how far the car travels during the reaction time, and then add that to the stopping time. It is reasonable to assume that the velocity remains constant during the driver’s reaction time.

1. Identify the knowns and what we want to solve for. We know that  We take  to be 0. We are looking for .

2. Identify the best equation to use. works well because the only unknown value is  , which is what we want to solve for.

3. Plug in the knowns to solve the equation.



This means the car travels  while the driver reacts, making the total displacements in the two cases of dry and wet concrete  greater than if he reacted instantly.

4. Add the displacement during the reaction time to the displacement when braking.



a.  when dry b.  when wet

  
FIGURE 2.34 The distance necessary to stop a car varies greatly, depending on road conditions and driver reaction time. Shown here are the braking distances for dry and wet pavement, as calculated in this example, for a car initially traveling at  . Also shown are the total distances traveled from the point where the driver first sees a light turn red, assuming a 0.500 s reaction time.

# Discussion

The displacements found in this example seem reasonable for stopping a fast-moving car. It should take longer to stop a car on wet rather than dry pavement. It is interesting that reaction time adds significantly to the displacements. But more important is the general approach to solving problems. We identify the knowns and the quantities to be determined and then find an appropriate equation. There is often more than one way to solve a problem. The various parts of this example can in fact be solved by other methods, but the solutions presented above are the shortest.

# EXAMPLE 2.13

# Calculating Time: A Car Merges into Traffic

Suppose a car merges into freeway traffic on a  -long ramp. If its initial velocity is  and it accelerates at  , how long does it take to travel the  up the ramp? (Such information might be useful to a traffic engineer.)

# Strategy

Draw a sketch.  
FIGURE 2.35

We are asked to solve for the time . As before, we identify the known quantities in order to choose a convenient physical relationship (that is, an equation with one unknown,  .

# Solution

1. Identify the knowns and what we want to solve for. We know that  ;  ; and  . 2. We need to solve for . Choose the best equation.  works best because the only unknown in the equation is the variable  for which we need to solve.

3. We will need to rearrange the equation to solve for  . In this case, it will be easier to plug in the knowns first.



4. Simplify the equation. The units of meters  cancel because they are in each term. We can get the units of seconds (s) to cancel by taking  , where  is the magnitude of time and s is the unit. Doing so leaves



5. Use the quadratic formula to solve for  .

(a) Rearrange the equation to get 0 on one side of the equation.



This is a quadratic equation of the form



where the constants are   , and  .

(b) Its solutions are given by the quadratic formula:



This yields two solutions for  , which are



In this case, then, the time is  in seconds, or



A negative value for time is unreasonable, since it would mean that the event happened 20 s before the motion began. We can discard that solution. Thus,



# Discussion

Whenever an equation contains an unknown squared, there will be two solutions. In some problems both solutionsare meaningful, but in others, such as the above, only one solution is reasonable. The 10.0 s answer seems reasonable for a typical freeway on-ramp.

With the basics of kinematics established, we can go on to many other interesting examples and applications. In the process of developing kinematics, we have also glimpsed a general approach to problem solving that produces both correct answers and insights into physical relationships. Problem-Solving Basics discusses problem-solving basics and outlines an approach that will help you succeed in this invaluable task.

# Making Connections: Take-Home Experiment—Breaking News

We have been using SI units of meters per second squared to describe some examples of acceleration or deceleration of cars, runners, and trains. To achieve a better feel for these numbers, one can measure the braking deceleration of a car doing a slow (and safe) stop. Recall that, for average acceleration,  . While traveling in a car, slowly apply the brakes as you come up to a stop sign. Have a passenger note the initial speed in miles per hour and the time taken (in seconds) to stop. From this, calculate the deceleration in miles per hour per second. Convert this to meters per second squared and compare with other decelerations mentioned in this chapter. Calculate the distance traveled in braking.

# 2.6 Problem-Solving Basics for One-Dimensional Kinematics

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Apply problem-solving steps and strategies to solve problems of one-dimensional kinematics. Apply strategies to determine whether or not the result of a problem is reasonable, and if not, determine the cause.

  
FIGURE 2.36 Problem-solving skills are essential to your success in Physics. (credit: scui3asteveo, Flickr)

Problem-solving skills are obviously essential to success in a quantitative course in physics. More importantly, the ability to apply broad physical principles, usually represented by equations, to specific situations is a very powerfulform of knowledge. It is much more powerful than memorizing a list of facts. Analytical skills and problem-solving abilities can be applied to new situations, whereas a list of facts cannot be made long enough to contain every possible circumstance. Such analytical skills are useful both for solving problems in this text and for applying physics in everyday and professional life.

# Problem-Solving Steps

While there is no simple step-by-step method that works for every problem, the following general procedures facilitate problem solving and make it more meaningful. A certain amount of creativity and insight is required as well.

# Step 1

the outset. You will also need to decide which direction is positive and note that on your sketch. Once you have identified the physical principles, it is much easier to find and apply the equations representing those principles. Although finding the correct equation is essential, keep in mind that equations represent physical principles, laws of nature, and relationships among physical quantities. Without a conceptual understanding of a problem, a numerical solution is meaningless.

# Step 2

stated very succinctly and require some inspection to determine what is known. A sketch can also be very useful at this point. Formally identifying the knowns is of particular importance in applying physics to real-world situations. Remember, “stopped” means velocity is zero, and we often can take initial time and position as zero.

# Step 3

Identiy exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identiy the unknowns. In complex problems, especially, it is not always obvious what needs to be found or in what sequence. Making a list can help.

# Step 4

Fin atin  tns hat nhelp you solvh oblYurn nw help here. It is easiest if you can find equations that contain only one unknown—that is, all of the other variables are known, so you can easily solve for the unknown. If the equation contains more than one unknown, then an additional equation is needed to solve the problem. In some problems, several unknowns must be determined to get at the one needed most. In such problems it is especially important to keep physical principles in mind to avoid going astray in a sea of equations. You may have to use two (or more) different equations to get the final answer.

# Step 5

Su . If the units of the answer are incorrect, then an error has been made. However, be warned that correct units do not guarantee that the numerical part of the answer is also correct.

# Step 6

C physics is to accurately describe nature. To see if the answer is reasonable, check both its magnitude and its sign, in addition to its units. Your judgment will improve as you solve more and more physics problems, and it will become possible for you to make finer and finer judgments regarding whether nature is adequately described by the answer to a problem. This step brings the problem back to its conceptual meaning. If you can judge whether the answer is reasonable, you have a deeper understanding of physics than just being able to mechanically solve a problem.

When solving problems, we often perform these steps in different order, and we also tend to do several steps simultaneously. There is no rigid procedure that will work every time. Creativity and insight grow with experience, and the basics of problem solving become almost automatic. One way to get practice is to work out the text’s examples for yourself as you read. Another is to work as many end-of-section problems as possible, starting with the easiest to build confidence and progressing to the more difficult. Once you become involved in physics, you will see it all around you, and you can begin to apply it to situations you encounter outside the classroom, just as is donein many of the applications in this text.

# Unreasonable Results

Physics must describe nature accurately. Some problems have results that are unreasonable because one premise is unreasonable or because certain premises are inconsistent with one another. The physical principle applied correctly then produces an unreasonable result. For example, if a person starting a foot race accelerates at  for 100 s, his final speed will be  (about  )—clearly unreasonable because the time of 100 s is an unreasonable premise. The physics is correct in a sense, but there is more to describing nature than just manipulating equations correctly. Checking the result of a problem to see if it is reasonable does more than help uncover errors in problem solving—it also builds intuition in judging whether nature is being accurately described.

Use the following strategies to determine whether an answer is reasonable and, if it is not, to determine what is the cause.

# Step 1

example given in the preceding paragraph, you would identify the givens as the acceleration and time and use the equation below to find the unknown final velocity. That is,



# Step 2

…? In this case, you may need to convert meters per second into a more familiar unit, such as miles per hour.



This velocity is about four times greater than a person can run—so it is too large.

# Step 3

l runner, there are only two assumptions that are suspect. The acceleration could be too great or the time too long. First look at the acceleration and think about what the number means. If someone accelerates at  , their velocity is increasing by  each second. Does this seem reasonable? If so, the time must be too long. It is not possible for someone to accelerate at a constant rate of  for  (almost two minutes).

# 2.7 Falling Objects

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Describe the effects of gravity on objects in motion.   
Describe the motion of objects that are in free fall.   
Calculate the position and velocity of objects in free fall.

Falling objects form an interesting class of motion problems. For example, we can estimate the depth of a vertical mine shaft by dropping a rock into it and listening for the rock to hit the bottom. By applying the kinematics developed so far to falling objects, we can examine some interesting situations and learn much about gravity in the process.

# Gravity

The most remarkable and unexpected fact about falling objects is that, if air resistance and friction are negligible, then in a given location all objects fall toward the center of Earth with the same constant acceleration, independent asspentallemiepece tm air resistance and friction that we expect light objects to fall slower than heavy ones.  
FIGURE 2.37 A hammer and a feather will fall with the same constant acceleration if air resistance is considered negligible. This is a general characteristic of gravity not unique to Earth, as astronaut David R. Scott demonstrated on the Moon in 1971, where the acceleration due to gravity is only  .

In the real world, air resistance can cause a lighter object to fall slower than a heavier object of the same size. A tennis ball will reach the ground after a hard baseball dropped at the same time. (It might be difficult to observe the difference if the height is not large.) Air resistance opposes the motion of an object through the air, while friction between objects—such as between clothes and a laundry chute or between a stone and a pool into which it is dropped—also opposes motion between them. For the ideal situations of these first few chapters, an object falling without air resistance or friction is defined to be in free-fall.

The force of gravity causes objects to fall toward the center of Earth. The acceleration of free-falling objects is therefore called the acceleration due to gravity. The acceleration due to gravity is constant, which means we can apply the kinematics equations to any falling object where air resistance and friction are negligible. This opens a broad class of interesting situations to us. The acceleration due to gravity is so important that its magnitude is given its own symbol, . It is constant at any given location on Earth and has the average value



Although  varies from  to  , depending on latitude, altitude, underlying geological formations, and local topography, the average value of  will be used in this text unless otherwise specified. The direction of the acceleration due to gravity is downward (towards the center of Earth). In fact, its direction defines what we call vertical. Note that whether the acceleration  in the kinematic equations has the value  or  depends on how we define our coordinate system. If we define the upward direction as positive, then  , and if we define the downward direction as positive, then  .

# One-Dimensional Motion Involving Gravity

The best way to see the basic features of motion involving gravity is to start with the simplest situations and then progress toward more complex ones. So we start by considering straight up and down motion with no air resistance or friction. These assumptions mean that the velocity (if there is any) is vertical. If the object is dropped, we know the initial velocity is zero. Once the object has left contact with whatever held or threw it, the object is in free-fall. Under these circumstances, the motion is one-dimensional and has constant acceleration of magnitude  . We will also represent vertical displacement with the symbol  and use  for horizontal displacement.

# Calculating Position and Velocity of a Falling Object: A Rock Thrown Upward

A person standing on the edge of a high cliff throws a rock straight up with an initial velocity of  . The rock misses the edge of the cliff as it falls back to earth. Calculate the position and velocity of the rock 1.00 s,  , and 3.00 s after it is thrown, neglecting the effects of air resistance.

# Strategy

Draw a sketch.

  
FIGURE 2.38

We are asked to determine the position  at various times. It is reasonable to take the initial position  to be zero. This problem involves one-dimensional motion in the vertical direction. We use plus and minus signs to indicate direction, with up being positive and down negative. Since up is positive, and the rock is thrown upward, the initial velocity must be positive too. The acceleration due to gravity is downward, so  is negative. It is crucial that the initial velocity and the acceleration due to gravity have opposite signs. Opposite signs indicate that the acceleration due to gravity opposes the initial motion and will slow and eventually reverse it.

Since we are asked for values of position and velocity at three times, we will refer to these as  and  and  and  and  .

# Solution for Position

FIGURE 2.39 Vertical position, vertical velocity, and vertical acceleration vs. time for a rock thrown vertically up at the edge of a cliff. Notice that velocity changes linearly with time and that acceleration is constant. Misconception Alert! Notice that the position vs. time graph shows vertical position only. It is easy to get the impression that the graph shows some horizontal motion—the shape of the graph looks like the path of a projectile. But this is not the case; the horizontal axis is time, not space. The actual path of the rock in space is straight up, and straight down.

# Discussion

The interpretation of these results is important. At 1.00 s the rock is above its starting point and heading upward, since  and  are both positive. At 2.00 s, the rock is still above its starting point, but the negative velocity means it is moving downward. At  , both  and  are negative, meaning the rock is below its starting point and continuing to move downward. Notice that when the rock is at its highest point (at 1.5 s), its velocity is zero, but its acceleration is still  . Its acceleration is  for the whole trip—while it is moving up and while it is moving down. Note that the values for  are the positions (or displacements) of the rock, not the total distances traveled. Finally, note that free-fall applies to upward motion as well as downward. Both have the same acceleration—the acceleration due to gravity, which remains constant the entire time. Astronauts training in the famous Vomit Comet, for example, experience free-fall while arcing up as well as down, as we will discuss in more detail later.# Making Connections: Take-Home Experiment—Reaction Time

A simple experiment can be done to determine your reaction time. Have a friend hold a ruler between your thumb and index finger, separated by about 1 cm. Note the mark on the ruler that is right between your fingers. Have your friend drop the ruler unexpectedly, and try to catch it between your two fingers. Note the new reading on the ruler. Assuming acceleration is that due to gravity, calculate your reaction time. How far would you travel in a car (moving at  ) if the time it took your foot to go from the gas pedal to the brake was twice this reaction time?

# EXAMPLE 2.15

# Calculating Velocity of a Falling Object: A Rock Thrown Down

What happens if the person on the cliff throws the rock straight down, instead of straight up? To explore this question, calculate the velocity of the rock when it is  below the starting point, and has been thrown downward with an initial speed of  .

# Strategy

Draw a sketch.

  
FIGURE 2.40

Since up is positive, the final position of the rock will be negative because it finishes below the starting point at  . Similarly, the initial velocity is downward and therefore negative, as is the acceleration due to gravity. We expect the final velocity to be negative since the rock will continue to move downward.

# Solution

1. Identify the knowns 

2. Choose the kinematic equation that makes it easiest to solve the problem. The equation  works well because the only unknown in it is  . (We will plug  in for  .)

3. Enter the known values



where we have retained extra significant figures because this is an intermediate result.

Taking the square root, and noting that a square root can be positive or negative, gives



The negative root is chosen to indicate that the rock is still heading down. Thus,



# Discussion

Note that this is exactly the same velocity the rock had at this position when it was thrown straight upward with the tal pee eEapl.1 nure.1aThisis ot a coiental esulBecue wy consider the acceleration due to gravity in this problem, the speed of a falling object depends only on its initialspeed and its vertical position relative to the starting point. For example, if the velocity of the rock is calculated at a height of  above the starting point (using the method from Example 2.14) when the initial velocity is  straight up, a result of  is obtained. Here both signs are meaningful; the positive value occurs when the rock is at  and heading up, and the negative value occurs when the rock is at  and heading back down. It has the same speed but the opposite direction.

  
FIGURE 2.41 (a) A person throws a rock straight up, as explored in Example 2.14. The arrows are velocity vectors at 0, 1.00, 2.00, and 3.00 s. (b) A person throws a rock straight down from a cliff with the same initial speed as before, as in Example 2.15. Note that at the same distance below the point of release, the rock has the same velocity in both cases.

Another way to look at it is this: In Example 2.14, the rock is thrown up with an initial velocity of  . It rises and then falls back down. When its position is  on its way back down, its velocity is  . That is, it has the same speed on its way down as on its way up. We would then expect its velocity at a position of  to be the same whether we have thrown it upwards at  or thrown it downwards at  . The velocity of the rock on its way down from  is the same whether we have thrown it up or down to start with, as long as the speed with which it was initially thrown is the same.# EXAMPLE 2.16

# Find g from Data on a Falling Object

The acceleration due to gravity on Earth differs slightly from place to place, depending on topography (e.g., whether you are on a hill or in a valley) and subsurface geology (whether there is dense rock like iron ore as opposed to light rock like salt beneath you.) The precise acceleration due to gravity can be calculated from data taken in an introductory physics laboratory course. An object, usually a metal ball for which air resistance is negligible, is dropped and the time it takes to fall a known distance is measured. See, for example, Figure 2.42. Very precise results can be produced with this method if sufficient care is taken in measuring the distance fallen and the elapsed time.

  
FIGURE 2.42 Positions and velocities of a metal ball released from rest when air resistance is negligible. Velocity is seen to increase linearly with time while displacement increases with time squared. Acceleration is a constant and is equal to gravitational acceleration.Suppose the ball falls  in 0.45173 s. Assuming the ball is not affected by air resistance, what is the precise acceleration due to gravity at this location?

# Strategy

Draw a sketch.

  
FIGURE 2.43

We need to solve for acceleration . Note that in this case, displacement is downward and therefore negative, as is acceleration.

# Solution

1. Identify the knowns. 

2. Choose the equation that allows you to solve for  using the known values.



3. Substitute 0 for  and rearrange the equation to solve for  . Substituting 0 for  yields



Solving for  gives



4. Substitute known values yields



so, because  with the directions we have chosen,



# Discussion

The negative value for  indicates that the gravitational acceleration is downward, as expected. We expect the value to be somewhere around the average value of  , so  makes sense. Since the data going into the calculation are relatively precise, this value for  is more precise than the average value of  ; it represents the local value for the acceleration due to gravity.

# 2.8 Graphical Analysis of One-Dimensional Motion

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Describe a straight-line graph in terms of its slope and y-intercept.   
Determine average velocity or instantaneous velocity from a graph of position vs. time.   
Determine average or instantaneous acceleration from a graph of velocity vs. time.   
Derive a graph of velocity vs. time from a graph of position vs. time.   
Derive a graph of acceleration vs. time from a graph of velocity vs. time.

A graph, like a picture, is worth a thousand words. Graphs not only contain numerical information; they also reveal relationships between physical quantities. This section uses graphs of position, velocity, and acceleration versus time to illustrate one-dimensional kinematics.

# Slopes and General Relationships

First note that graphs in this text have perpendicular axes, one horizontal and the other vertical. When two physical quantities are plotted against one another in such a graph, the horizontal axis is usually considered to be an independent variable and the vertical axis a dependent variable. If we call the horizontal axis the  -axis and the vertical axis the  -axis, as in Figure 2.44, a straight-line graph has the general form



Here  is the slope, defined to be the rise divided by the run (as seen in the figure) of the straight line. The letter  is used for the  -intercept, which is the point at which the line crosses the vertical axis.

  
FIGURE 2.44 A straight-line graph. The equation for a straight line is  .# Graph of Position vs. Time (  , so  is constant)

Time is usually an independent variable that other quantities, such as position, depend upon. A graph of position versus time would, thus, have  on the vertical axis and  on the horizontal axis. Figure 2.45 is just such a straightline graph. It shows a graph of position versus time for a jet-powered car on a very flat dry lake bed in Nevada.

  
FIGURE 2.45 Graph of position versus time for a jet-powered car on the Bonneville Salt Flats.

Using the relationship between dependent and independent variables, we see that the slope in the graph above is average velocity  and the intercept is position at time zero—that is,  . Substituting these symbols into  gives



or



Thus a graph of position versus time gives a general relationship among displacement(change in position), velocity, and time, as well as giving detailed numerical information about a specific situation.

# The Slope of x vs. t

The slope of the graph of position  vs. time  is velocity  .



Notice that this equation is the same as that derived algebraically from other motion equations in Motion Equations for Constant Acceleration in One Dimension.

From the figure we can see that the car has a position of  at 0.50 s and  at  . Its position at other times can be read from the graph; furthermore, information about its velocity and acceleration can also be obtained from the graph.

# EXAMPLE 2.17

# Determining Average Velocity from a Graph of Position versus Time: Jet Car

Find the average velocity of the car whose position is graphed in Figure 2.45.

# Strategy

The slope of a graph of  vs.  is average velocity, since slope equals rise over run. In this case, rise  change in position and run  change in time, so that

Since the slope is constant here, any two points on the graph can be used to find the slope. (Generally speaking, it is most accurate to use two widely separated points on the straight line. This is because any error in reading data from the graph is proportionally smaller if the interval is larger.)

# Solution

1. Choose two points on the line. In this case, we choose the points labeled on the graph: (6.4 s, 2000 m) and (0.50 s,  ). (Note, however, that you could choose any two points.)

2. Substitute the  and  values of the chosen points into the equation. Remember in calculating change  we always use final value minus initial value.

This is an impressively large land speed  , or about  : much greater than the typical highway speed limit of 60 mi/h  or  ), but considerably shy of the record of   h or  set in 1997.

# Graphs of Motion when  is constant but 

The graphs in Figure 2.46 below represent the motion of the jet-powered car as it accelerates toward its top speed, but only during the time when its acceleration is constant. Time starts at zero for this motion (as if measured with a stopwatch), and the position and velocity are initially  and  , respectively.  
FIGURE 2.46 Graphs of motion of a jet-powered car during the time span when its acceleration is constant. (a) The slope of an vs. graph is velocity. This is shown at two points, and the instantaneous velocities obtained are plotted in the next graph. Instantaneous velocity at any point is the slope of the tangent at that point. (b) The slope of the  vs. graph is constant for this part of the motion, indicating constant acceleration. (c) Acceleration has the constant value of  over the time interval plotted.  
FIGURE 2.47 A U.S. Air Force jet car speeds down a track. (credit: Matt Trostle, Flickr)

The graph of position versus time in Figure 2.46(a) is a curve rather than a straight line. The slope of the curve becomes steeper as time progresses, showing that the velocity is increasing over time. The slope at any point on a position-versus-time graph is the instantaneous velocity at that point. It is found by drawing a straight line tangent to the curve at the point of interest and taking the slope of this straight line. Tangent lines are shown for two points in Figure 2.46(a). If this is done at every point on the curve and the values are plotted against time, then the graph of velocity versus time shown in Figure 2.46(b) is obtained. Furthermore, the slope of the graph of velocity versus time is acceleration, which is shown in Figure 2.46(c).

# EXAMPLE 2.18

# Determining Instantaneous Velocity from the Slope at a Point: Jet Car

Calculate the velocity of the jet car at a time of 25 s by finding the slope of the  vs.  graph in the graph below.

  
FIGURE 2.48 The slope of an  vs. graph is velocity. This is shown at two points. Instantaneous velocity at any point is the slope of the tangent at that point.

# Strategy

The slope of a curve at a point is equal to the slope of a straight line tangent to the curve at that point. This principle is illustrated in Figure 2.48, where  is the point at  .

# Solution

1. Find the tangent line to the curve at  .   
2. Determine the endpoints of the tangent. These correspond to a position of  at time 19 s and a position of  at time 32 s.   
3. Plug these endpoints into the equation to solve for the slope,  .

Thus,



# Discussion

This is the value given in this figure’s table for  at  . The value of  for  is plotted in Figure 2.48.   
The entire graph of  vs.  can be obtained in this fashion.

Carrying this one step further, we note that the slope of a velocity versus time graph is acceleration. Slope is rise divided by run; on a  vs.  graph, rise  change in velocity  and run  change in time  .

# The Slope of v vs. t

The slope of a graph of velocity  vs. time  is acceleration  .



Since the velocity versus time graph in Figure 2.46(b) is a straight line, its slope is the same everywhere, implying that acceleration is constant. Acceleration versus time is graphed in Figure 2.46(c).

Additional general information can be obtained from Figure 2.48 and the expression for a straight line, 

In this case, the vertical axis  is  , the intercept  is  , the slope  is  , and the horizontal axis  is . Substituting these symbols yields



A general relationship for velocity, acceleration, and time has again been obtained from a graph. Notice that this equation was also derived algebraically from other motion equations in Motion Equations for Constant Acceleration in One Dimension.

It is not accidental that the same equations are obtained by graphical analysis as by algebraic techniques. In fact, an important way to discover physical relationships is to measure various physical quantities and then make graphs of one quantity against another to see if they are correlated in any way. Correlations imply physical relationships and might be shown by smooth graphs such as those above. From such graphs, mathematical relationships can sometimes be postulated. Further experiments are then performed to determine the validity of the hypothesized relationships.

# Graphs of Motion Where Acceleration is Not Constant

Now consider the motion of the jet car as it goes from  to its top velocity of  , graphed in Figure 2.49. Time again starts at zero, and the initial velocity is  . (This was the final velocity of the car in the motion graphed in Figure 2.46.) Acceleration gradually decreases from  to zero when the car hits  . The velocity increases until 55 s and then becomes constant, since acceleration decreases to zero at 55 s and remains zero afterward.  
FIGURE 2.49 Graphs of motion of a jet-powered car as it reaches its top velocity. This motion begins where the motion in Figure 2.46 ends. (a) The velocity gradually approaches its top value. The slope of this graph is acceleration. It is plotted in the final graph. (b) Acceleration gradually declines to zero when velocity becomes constant. Notice in each of the three graphs that the acceleration drops down to zero and the velocity levels out. This results in a position-time graph that is almost linear. A close-up of the position time graph would show a slight curvature, as indicated in the velocity graph.

# EXAMPLE 2.19

# Calculating Acceleration from a Graph of Velocity versus Time

Calculate the acceleration of the jet car at a time of 25 s by finding the slope of the  vs. graph in Figure 2.49(a).

# Strategy

The slope of the curve at  is equal to the slope of the line tangent at that point, as illustrated in Figure 2.49(a).

# Solution

Determine endpoints of the tangent line from the figure, and then plug them into the equation to solve for slope, .





# Discussion

Note that this value for  is consistent with the value plotted in Figure 2.49(b) at  .

A graph of position versus time can be used to generate a graph of velocity versus time, and a graph of velocityversus time can be used to generate a graph of acceleration versus time. We do this by finding the slope of the graphs at every point. If the graph is linear (i.e., a line with a constant slope), it is easy to find the slope at any point and you have the slope for every point. Graphical analysis of motion can be used to describe both specific and general characteristics of kinematics. Graphs can also be used for other topics in physics. An important aspect of exploring physical relationships is to graph them and look for underlying relationships.

# Section Summary

# 2.1 Displacement

• Kinematics is the study of motion without considering its causes. In this chapter, it is limited to motion along a straight line, called onedimensional motion.   
Displacement is the change in position of an object.   
In symbols, displacement  is defined to be  where  is the initial position and  is the final position. In this text, the Greek letter  (delta) always means “change in” whatever quantity follows it. The SI unit for displacement is the meter  . Displacement has a direction as well as a magnitude.   
When you start a problem, assign which direction will be positive. Distance is the magnitude of displacement between two positions.   
Distance traveled is the total length of the path traveled between two positions.

# 2.2 Vectors, Scalars, and Coordinate Systems

• A vector is any quantity that has magnitude and direction.   
• A scalar is any quantity that has magnitude but no direction. Displacement and velocity are vectors, whereas distance and speed are scalars. In one-dimensional motion, direction is specified by a plus or minus sign to signify left or right, up or down, and the like.

# 2.3 Time, Velocity, and Speed

• Time is measured in terms of change, and its SI unit is the second (s). Elapsed time for an event is  where  is the final time and  is the initial time. The initial time is often taken to be zero, as if measured with a stopwatch; the elapsed time is then just  . Average velocity  is defined as displacement divided by the travel time. In symbols, average velocity is

• The SI unit for velocity is  .   
• Velocity is a vector and thus has a direction. Instantaneous velocity  is the velocity at a specific instant or the average velocity for an infinitesimal interval. Instantaneous speed is the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity. Instantaneous speed is a scalar quantity, as it has no direction specified. Average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the elapsed time. (Average speed is not the magnitude of the average velocity.) Speed is a scalar quantity; it has no direction associated with it.

# 2.4 Acceleration

• Acceleration is the rate at which velocity changes. In symbols, average acceleration  is    
• The SI unit for acceleration is  .   
• Acceleration is a vector, and thus has a both a magnitude and direction. Acceleration can be caused by either a change in the magnitude or the direction of the velocity. Instantaneous acceleration  is the acceleration at a specific instant in time.   
• Deceleration is an acceleration with a direction opposite to that of the velocity.

# 2.5 Motion Equations for Constant Acceleration in One Dimension

• To simplify calculations we take acceleration to be constant, so that  at all times. We also take initial time to be zero. Initial position and velocity are given a subscript 0; final values have no subscript. Thus,  The following kinematic equations for motion with constant  are useful:    
• In vertical motion,  is substituted for  .

# 2.6 Problem-Solving Basics for OneDimensional Kinematics

• The six basic problem solving steps for physics are: Step 1. Examine the situation to determine which physical principles are involved. Step 2. Make a list of what is given or can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns). Step 3. Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns). Step 4. Find an equation or set of equations that can help you solve the problem. Step 5. Substitute the knowns along with their units into the appropriate equation, and obtain numerical solutions complete with units. Step 6. Check the answer to see if it is reasonable: Does it make sense?

# 2.7 Falling Objects

• An object in free-fall experiences constant acceleration if air resistance is negligible.   
On Earth, all free-falling objects have an acceleration due to gravity  , which averages  . Whether the acceleration a should be taken as  or  is determined by your choice of coordinate system. If you choose the upward direction as positive,  is negative. In the opposite case,  is positive. Since acceleration is constant, the kinematic equations above can be applied with the appropriate  or  substituted for  . For objects in free-fall, up is normally taken as positive for displacement, velocity, and acceleration.

# 2.8 Graphical Analysis of One-Dimensional Motion

• Graphs of motion can be used to analyze motion.   
• Graphical solutions yield identical solutions to mathematical methods for deriving motion equations.   
• The slope of a graph of displacement  vs. time  is velocity  .   
The slope of a graph of velocity  vs. time  graph is acceleration  .   
• Average velocity, instantaneous velocity, and acceleration can all be obtained by analyzinggraphs.
