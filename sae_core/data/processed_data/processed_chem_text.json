  "PREFACE",
  "In offering this book to teachers of elementary chemistry the authors\nlay no claim to any great originality. It has been their aim to prepare\na text-book constructed along lines which have become recognized as best\nsuited to an elementary treatment of the subject. At the same time they\nhave made a consistent effort to make the text clear in outline, simple\nin style and language, conservatively modern in point of view, and\nthoroughly teachable.",
  "The question as to what shall be included in an elementary text on\nchemistry is perhaps the most perplexing one which an author must\nanswer. While an enthusiastic chemist with a broad understanding of the\nscience is very apt to go beyond the capacity of the elementary student,\nthe authors of this text, after an experience of many years, cannot help\nbelieving that the tendency has been rather in the other direction. In\nmany texts no mention at all is made of fundamental laws of chemical\naction because their complete presentation is quite beyond the\ncomprehension of the student, whereas in many cases it is possible to\npresent the essential features of these laws in a way that will be of\nreal assistance in the understanding of the science. For example, it is\na difficult matter to deduce the law of mass action in any very simple\nway; yet the elementary student can readily comprehend that reactions\nare reversible, and that the point of equilibrium depends upon, rather\nsimple conditions. The authors believe that it is worth while to\npresent such principles in even an elementary and partial manner because\nthey are of great assistance to the general student, and because they\nmake a foundation upon which the student who continues his studies to\nmore advanced courses can securely build.",
  "The authors have no apologies to make for the extent to which they have\nmade use of the theory of electrolytic dissociation. It is inevitable\nthat in any rapidly developing science there will be differences of\nopinion in regard to the value of certain theories. There can be no\nquestion, however, that the outline of the theory of dissociation here\npresented is in accord with the views of the very great majority of the\nchemists of the present time. Moreover, its introduction to the extent\nto which the authors have presented it simplifies rather than increases\nthe difficulties with which the development of the principles of the\nscience is attended.",
  "The oxygen standard for atomic weights has been adopted throughout the\ntext. The International Committee, to which is assigned the duty of\nyearly reporting a revised list of the atomic weights of the elements,\nhas adopted this standard for their report, and there is no longer any\nauthority for the older hydrogen standard. The authors do not believe\nthat the adoption of the oxygen standard introduces any real\ndifficulties in making perfectly clear the methods by which atomic\nweights are calculated.",
  "The problems appended to the various chapters have been chosen with a\nview not only of fixing the principles developed in the text in the mind\nof the student, but also of enabling him to answer such questions as\narise in his laboratory work. They are, therefore, more or less\npractical in character. It is not necessary that all of them should be\nsolved, though with few exceptions the lists are not long. The answers\nto the questions are not directly given in the text as a rule, but can\nbe inferred from the statements made. They therefore require independent\nthought on the part of the student.",
  "With very few exceptions only such experiments are included in the text\nas cannot be easily carried out by the student. It is expected that\nthese will be performed by the teacher at the lecture table. Directions\nfor laboratory work by the student are published in a separate volume.",
  "While the authors believe that the most important function of the\nelementary text is to develop the principles of the science, they\nrecognize the importance of some discussion of the practical application\nof these principles to our everyday life. Considerable space is\ntherefore devoted to this phase of chemistry. The teacher should\nsupplement this discussion whenever possible by having the class visit\ndifferent factories where chemical processes are employed.",
  "Although this text is now for the first time offered to teachers of\nelementary chemistry, it has nevertheless been used by a number of\nteachers during the past three years. The present edition has been\nlargely rewritten in the light of the criticisms offered, and we desire\nto express our thanks to the many teachers who have helped us in this\nrespect, especially to Dr. William Lloyd Evans of this laboratory, a\nteacher of wide experience, for his continued interest and helpfulness.\nWe also very cordially solicit correspondence with teachers who may find\ndifficulties or inaccuracies in the text.",
  "The authors wish to make acknowledgments for the photographs and\nengravings of eminent chemists from which the cuts included in the text\nwere taken; to Messrs. Elliott and Fry, London, England, for that of\nRamsay; to The Macmillan Company for those of Davy and Dalton, taken\nfrom the Century Science Series; to the L. E. Knott Apparatus Company,\nBoston, for that of Bunsen.",

  "AN ELEMENTARY STUDY OF CHEMISTRY",
  "CHAPTER I",
  "INTRODUCTION",
  "~The natural sciences.~ Before we advance very far in the study of nature,\nit becomes evident that the one large study must be divided into a\nnumber of more limited ones for the convenience of the investigator as\nwell as of the student. These more limited studies are called the\n_natural sciences_.",
  "Since the study of nature is divided in this way for mere convenience,\nand not because there is any division in nature itself, it often happens\nthat the different sciences are very intimately related, and a thorough\nknowledge of any one of them involves a considerable acquaintance with\nseveral others. Thus the botanist must know something about animals as\nwell as about plants; the student of human physiology must know\nsomething about physics as well as about the parts of the body.",
  "~Intimate relation of chemistry and physics.~ Physics and chemistry are\ntwo sciences related in this close way, and it is not easy to make a\nprecise distinction between them. In a general way it may be said that\nthey are both concerned with inanimate matter rather than with living,\nand more particularly with the changes which such matter may be made to\nundergo. These changes must be considered more closely before a\ndefinition of the two sciences can be given.",
  "~Physical changes.~ One class of changes is not accompanied by an\nalteration in the composition of matter. When a lump of coal is broken\nthe pieces do not differ from the original lump save in size. A rod of\niron may be broken into pieces; it may be magnetized; it may be heated\nuntil it glows; it may be melted. In none of these changes has the\ncomposition of the iron been affected. The pieces of iron, the\nmagnetized iron, the glowing iron, the melted iron, are just as truly\niron as was the original rod. Sugar may be dissolved in water, but\nneither the sugar nor the water is changed in composition. The resulting\nliquid has the sweet taste of sugar; moreover the water may be\nevaporated by heating and the sugar recovered unchanged. Such changes\nare called _physical changes_.",
  "DEFINITION: _Physical changes are those which do not involve a change in\nthe composition of the matter._",
  "~Chemical changes.~ Matter may undergo other changes in which its\ncomposition is altered. When a lump of coal is burned ashes and\ninvisible gases are formed which are entirely different in composition\nand properties from the original coal. A rod of iron when exposed to\nmoist air is gradually changed into rust, which is entirely different\nfrom the original iron. When sugar is heated a black substance is formed\nwhich is neither sweet nor soluble in water. Such changes are evidently\nquite different from the physical changes just described, for in them\nnew substances are formed in place of the ones undergoing change.\nChanges of this kind are called _chemical changes_.",
  "DEFINITION: _Chemical changes are those which involve a change in the\ncomposition of the matter._",
  "~How to distinguish between physical and chemical changes.~ It is not\nalways easy to tell to which class a given change belongs, and many\ncases will require careful thought on the part of the student. The test\nquestion in all cases is, Has the composition of the substance been\nchanged? Usually this can be answered by a study of the properties of\nthe substance before and after the change, since a change in composition\nis attended by a change in properties. In some cases, however, only a\ntrained observer can decide the question.",
  "~Changes in physical state.~ One class of physical changes should be noted\nwith especial care, since it is likely to prove misleading. It is a\nfamiliar fact that ice is changed into water, and water into steam, by\nheating. Here we have three different substances,--the solid ice, the\nliquid water, and the gaseous steam,--the properties of which differ\nwidely. The chemist can readily show, however, that these three bodies\nhave exactly the same composition, being composed of the same substances\nin the same proportion. Hence the change from one of these substances\ninto another is a physical change. Many other substances may, under\nsuitable conditions, be changed from solids into liquids, or from\nliquids into gases, without change in composition. Thus butter and wax\nwill melt when heated; alcohol and gasoline will evaporate when exposed\nto the air. _The three states--solid, liquid, and gas--are called the\nthree physical states of matter._",
  "~Physical and chemical properties.~ Many properties of a substance can be\nnoted without causing the substance to undergo chemical change, and are\ntherefore called its _physical properties_. Among these are its physical\nstate, color, odor, taste, size, shape, weight. Other properties are\nonly discovered when the substance undergoes chemical change. These are\ncalled its _chemical properties_. Thus we find that coal burns in air,\ngunpowder explodes when ignited, milk sours when exposed to air.",
  "~Definition of physics and chemistry.~ It is now possible to make a\ngeneral distinction between physics and chemistry.",
  "DEFINITION: _Physics is the science which deals with those changes in\nmatter which do not involve a change in composition._",
  "DEFINITION: _Chemistry is the science which deals with those changes in\nmatter which do involve a change in composition._",
  "~Two factors in all changes.~ In all the changes which matter can undergo,\nwhether physical or chemical, two factors must be taken into account,\nnamely, _energy_ and _matter_.",
  "~Energy.~ It is a familiar fact that certain bodies have the power to do\nwork. Thus water falling from a height upon a water wheel turns the\nwheel and in this way does the work of the mills. Magnetized iron\nattracts iron to itself and the motion of the iron as it moves towards\nthe magnet can be made to do work. When coal is burned it causes the\nengine to move and transports the loaded cars from place to place. When\na body has this power to do work it is said to possess energy.",
  "~Law of conservation of energy.~ Careful experiments have shown that when\none body parts with its energy the energy is not destroyed but is\ntransferred to another body or system of bodies. Just as energy cannot\nbe destroyed, neither can it be created. If one body gains a certain\namount of energy, some other body has lost an equivalent amount. These\nfacts are summed up in the law of conservation of energy which may be\nstated thus: _While energy can be changed from one form into another, it\ncannot be created or destroyed._",
  "~Transformations of energy.~ Although energy can neither be created nor\ndestroyed, it is evident that it may assume many different forms. Thus\nthe falling water may turn the electric generator and produce a current\nof electricity. The energy lost by the falling water is thus transformed\ninto the energy of the electric current. This in turn may be changed\ninto the energy of motion, as when the current is used for propelling\nthe cars, or into the energy of heat and light, as when it is used for\nheating and lighting the cars. Again, the energy of coal may be\nconverted into energy of heat and subsequently of motion, as when it is\nused as a fuel in steam engines.",
  "Since the energy possessed by coal only becomes available when the coal\nis made to undergo a chemical change, it is sometimes called _chemical\nenergy_. It is this form of energy in which we are especially interested\nin the study of chemistry.",
  "~Matter.~ Matter may be defined as that which occupies space and possesses\nweight. Like energy, matter may be changed oftentimes from one form into\nanother; and since in these transformations all the other physical\nproperties of a substance save weight are likely to change, the inquiry\narises, Does the weight also change? Much careful experimenting has\nshown that it does not. The weight of the products formed in any change\nin matter always equals the weight of the substances undergoing change.",
  "~Law of conservation of matter.~ The important truth just stated is\nfrequently referred to as the law of conservation of matter, and this\nlaw may be briefly stated thus: _Matter can neither be created nor\ndestroyed, though it can be changed from one form into another._",
  "~Classification of matter.~ At first sight there appears to be no limit to\nthe varieties of matter of which the world is made. For convenience in\nstudy we may classify all these varieties under three heads, namely,\n_mechanical mixtures_, _chemical compounds_, and _elements_.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 1]",
  "~Mechanical mixtures.~ If equal bulks of common salt and iron filings are\nthoroughly mixed together, a product is obtained which, judging by its\nappearance, is a new substance. If it is examined more closely, however,\nit will be seen to be merely a mixture of the salt and iron, each of\nwhich substances retains its own peculiar properties. The mixture tastes\njust like salt; the iron particles can be seen and their gritty\ncharacter detected. A magnet rubbed in the mixture draws out the iron\njust as if the salt were not there. On the other hand, the salt can be\nseparated from the iron quite easily. Thus, if several grams of the\nmixture are placed in a test tube, and the tube half filled with water\nand thoroughly shaken, the salt dissolves in the water. The iron\nparticles can then be filtered from the liquid by pouring the entire\nmixture upon a piece of filter paper folded so as to fit into the\ninterior of a funnel (Fig. 1). The paper retains the solid but allows\nthe clear liquid, known as the _filtrate_, to drain through. The iron\nparticles left upon the filter paper will be found to be identical with\nthe original iron. The salt can be recovered from the filtrate by\nevaporation of the water. To accomplish this the filtrate is poured into\na small evaporating dish and gently heated (Fig. 2) until the water has\ndisappeared, or _evaporated_. The solid left in the dish is identical in\nevery way with the original salt. Both the iron and the salt have thus\nbeen recovered in their original condition. It is evident that no new\nsubstance has been formed by rubbing the salt and iron together. The\nproduct is called a _mechanical mixture_. Such mixtures are very common\nin nature, almost all minerals, sands, and soils being examples of this\nclass of substances. It is at once apparent that there is no law\nregulating the composition of a mechanical mixture, and no two mixtures\nare likely to have exactly the same composition. The ingredients of a\nmechanical mixture can usually be separated by mechanical means, such as\nsifting, sorting, magnetic attraction, or by dissolving one constituent\nand leaving the other unchanged.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 2]",
  "DEFINITION: _A mechanical mixture is one in which the constituents\nretain their original properties, no chemical action having taken place\nwhen they were brought together._",
  "~Chemical compounds.~ If iron filings and powdered sulphur are thoroughly\nground together in a mortar, a yellowish-green substance results. It\nmight easily be taken to be a new body; but as in the case of the iron\nand salt, the ingredients can readily be separated. A magnet draws out\nthe iron. Water does not dissolve the sulphur, but other liquids do, as,\nfor example, the liquid called carbon disulphide. When the mixture is\ntreated with carbon disulphide the iron is left unchanged, and the\nsulphur can be obtained again, after filtering off the iron, by\nevaporating the liquid. The substance is, therefore, a mechanical\nmixture.",
  "If now a new portion of the mixture is placed in a dry test tube and\ncarefully heated in the flame of a Bunsen burner, as shown in Fig. 3, a\nstriking change takes place. The mixture begins to glow at some point,\nthe glow rapidly extending throughout the whole mass. If the test tube\nis now broken and the product examined, it will be found to be a hard,\nblack, brittle substance, in no way recalling the iron or the sulphur.\nThe magnet no longer attracts it; carbon disulphide will not dissolve\nsulphur from it. It is a new substance with new properties, resulting\nfrom the chemical union of iron and sulphur, and is called iron\nsulphide. Such substances are called _chemical compounds_, and differ\nfrom mechanical mixtures in that the substances producing them lose\ntheir own characteristic properties. We shall see later that the two\nalso differ in that the composition of a chemical compound never varies.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 3]",
  "DEFINITION: _A chemical compound is a substance the constituents of\nwhich have lost their own characteristic properties, and which cannot be\nseparated save by a chemical change._",
  "~Elements.~ It has been seen that iron sulphide is composed of two\nentirely different substances,--iron and sulphur. The question arises,\nDo these substances in turn contain other substances, that is, are they\nalso chemical compounds? Chemists have tried in a great many ways to\ndecompose them, but all their efforts have failed. Substances which have\nresisted all efforts to decompose them into other substances are called\n_elements_. It is not always easy to prove that a given substance is\nreally an element. Some way as yet untried may be successful in\ndecomposing it into other simpler forms of matter, and the supposed\nelement will then prove to be a compound. Water, lime, and many other\nfamiliar compounds were at one time thought to be elements.",
  "DEFINITION: _An element is a substance which cannot be separated into\nsimpler substances by any known means._",
  "~Kinds of matter.~ While matter has been grouped in three classes for the\npurpose of study, it will be apparent that there are really but two\ndistinct kinds of matter, namely, compounds and elements. A mechanical\nmixture is not a third distinct kind of matter, but is made up of\nvarying quantities of either compounds or elements or both.",
  "~Alchemy.~ In olden times it was thought that some way could be found to\nchange one element into another, and a great many efforts were made to\naccomplish this transformation. Most of these efforts were directed\ntoward changing the commoner metals into gold, and many fanciful ways\nfor doing this were described. The chemists of that time were called\n_alchemists_, and the art which they practiced was called _alchemy_. The\nalchemists gradually became convinced that the only way common metals\ncould be changed into gold was by the wonderful power of a magic\nsubstance which they called the _philosopher's stone_, which would\naccomplish this transformation by its mere touch and would in addition\ngive perpetual youth to its fortunate possessor. No one has ever found\nsuch a stone, and no one has succeeded in changing one metal into\nanother.",
  "~Number of elements.~ The number of substances now considered to be\nelements is not large--about eighty in all. Many of these are rare, and\nvery few of them make any large fraction of the materials in the\nearth's crust. Clarke gives the following estimate of the composition of\nthe earth's crust:",
  "Oxygen       47.0%       Calcium           3.5%\n    Silicon      27.9        Magnesium         2.5\n    Aluminium     8.1        Sodium            2.7\n    Iron          4.7        Potassium         2.4\n                Other elements       1.2%",
  "A complete list of the elements is given in the Appendix. In this list\nthe more common of the elements are marked with an asterisk. It is not\nnecessary to study more than a third of the total number of elements to\ngain a very good knowledge of chemistry.",
  "~Physical state of the elements.~ About ten of the elements are gases at\nordinary temperatures. Two--mercury and bromine--are liquids. The others\nare all solids, though their melting points vary through wide limits,\nfrom cæsium which melts at 26° to elements which do not melt save in the\nintense heat of the electric furnace.",
  "~Occurrence of the elements.~ Comparatively few of the elements occur as\nuncombined substances in nature, most of them being found in the form of\nchemical compounds. When an element does occur by itself, as is the case\nwith gold, we say that it occurs in the _free state_ or _native_; when\nit is combined with other substances in the form of compounds, we say\nthat it occurs in the _combined state_, or _in combination_. In the\nlatter case there is usually little about the compound to suggest that\nthe element is present in it; for we have seen that elements lose their\nown peculiar properties when they enter into combination with other\nelements. It would never be suspected, for example, that the reddish,\nearthy-looking iron ore contains iron.",
  "~Names of elements.~ The names given to the elements have been selected in\na great many different ways. (1) Some names are very old and their\noriginal meaning is obscure. Such names are iron, gold, and copper. (2)\nMany names indicate some striking physical property of the element. The\nname bromine, for example, is derived from a Greek word meaning a\nstench, referring to the extremely unpleasant odor of the substance. The\nname iodine comes from a word meaning violet, alluding to the beautiful\ncolor of iodine vapor. (3) Some names indicate prominent chemical\nproperties of the elements. Thus, nitrogen means the producer of niter,\nnitrogen being a constituent of niter or saltpeter. Hydrogen means water\nformer, signifying its presence in water. Argon means lazy or inert, the\nelement being so named because of its inactivity. (4) Other elements are\nnamed from countries or localities, as germanium and scandium.",
  "~Symbols.~ In indicating the elements found in compounds it is\ninconvenient to use such long names, and hence chemists have adopted a\nsystem of abbreviations. These abbreviations are known as _symbols_,\neach element having a distinctive symbol. (1) Sometimes the initial\nletter of the name will suffice to indicate the element. Thus I stands\nfor iodine, C for carbon. (2) Usually it is necessary to add some other\ncharacteristic letter to the symbol, since several names may begin with\nthe same letter. Thus C stands for carbon, Cl for chlorine, Cd for\ncadmium, Ce for cerium, Cb for columbium. (3) Sometimes the symbol is an\nabbreviation of the old Latin name. In this way Fe (ferrum) indicates\niron, Cu (cuprum), copper, Au (aurum), gold. The symbols are included in\nthe list of elements given in the Appendix. They will become familiar\nthrough constant use.",
  "~Chemical affinity the cause of chemical combination.~ The agency which\ncauses substances to combine and which holds them together when combined\nis called _chemical affinity_. The experiments described in this\nchapter, however, show that heat is often necessary to bring about\nchemical action. The distinction between the cause producing chemical\naction and the circumstances favoring it must be clearly made. Chemical\naffinity is always the cause of chemical union. Many agencies may make\nit possible for chemical affinity to act by overcoming circumstances\nwhich stand in its way. Among these agencies are heat, light, and\nelectricity. As a rule, solution also promotes action between two\nsubstances. Sometimes these agencies may overcome chemical attraction\nand so occasion the decomposition of a compound.",

  "OXYGEN",
  "~History.~ The discovery of oxygen is generally attributed to the English\nchemist Priestley, who in 1774 obtained the element by heating a\ncompound of mercury and oxygen, known as red oxide of mercury. It is\nprobable, however, that the Swedish chemist Scheele had previously\nobtained it, although an account of his experiments was not published\nuntil 1777. The name oxygen signifies acid former. It was given to the\nelement by the French chemist Lavoisier, since he believed that all\nacids owe their characteristic properties to the presence of oxygen.\nThis view we now know to be incorrect.",
  "~Occurrence.~ Oxygen is by far the most abundant of all the elements. It\noccurs both in the free and in the combined state. In the free state it\noccurs in the air, 100 volumes of dry air containing about 21 volumes of\noxygen. In the combined state it forms eight ninths of water and nearly\none half of the rocks composing the earth's crust. It is also an\nimportant constituent of the compounds which compose plant and animal\ntissues; for example, about 66% by weight of the human body is oxygen.",
  "~Preparation.~ Although oxygen occurs in the free state in the atmosphere,\nits separation from the nitrogen and other gases with which it is mixed\nis such a difficult matter that in the laboratory it has been found more\nconvenient to prepare it from its compounds. The most important of the\nlaboratory methods are the following:",
  "1. _Preparation from water._ Water is a compound, consisting of 11.18%\nhydrogen and 88.82% oxygen. It is easily separated into these\nconstituents by passing an electric current through it under suitable\nconditions. The process will be described in the chapter on water. While\nthis method of preparation is a simple one, it is not economical.",
  "2. _Preparation from mercuric oxide._ This method is of interest, since\nit is the one which led to the discovery of oxygen. The oxide, which\nconsists of 7.4% oxygen and 92.6% mercury, is placed in a small, glass\ntest tube and heated. The compound is in this way decomposed into\nmercury which collects on the sides of the glass tube, forming a silvery\nmirror, and oxygen which, being a gas, escapes from the tube. The\npresence of the oxygen is shown by lighting the end of a splint,\nextinguishing the flame and bringing the glowing coal into the mouth of\nthe tube. The oxygen causes the glowing coal to burst into a flame.",
  "In a similar way oxygen may be obtained from its compounds with\n     some of the other elements. Thus manganese dioxide, a black\n     compound of manganese and oxygen, when heated to about 700°,\n     loses one third of its oxygen, while barium dioxide, when\n     heated, loses one half of its oxygen.",
  "3. _Preparation from potassium chlorate (usual laboratory method)._\nPotassium chlorate is a white solid which consists of 31.9% potassium,\n28.9% chlorine, and 39.2% oxygen. When heated it undergoes a series of\nchanges in which all the oxygen is finally set free, leaving a compound\nof potassium and chlorine called potassium chloride. The change may be\nrepresented as follows:",
  "/potassium\\\n  |           | (potassium     / potassium \\ (potassium\n {  chlorine   }            = {             }             + oxygen\n  |           |  chlorate)     \\ chlorine  /  chloride)\n   \\oxygen   /",
  "[Illustration: JOSEPH PRIESTLEY (English) (1733-1804)",
  "School-teacher, theologian, philosopher, scientist; friend of Benjamin\nFranklin; discoverer of oxygen; defender of the phlogiston theory; the\nfirst to use mercury in a pneumatic trough, by which means he first\nisolated in gaseous form hydrochloric acid, sulphur dioxide, and\nammonia]",
  "The evolution of the oxygen begins at about 400°. It has been found,\nhowever, that if the potassium chlorate is mixed with about one fourth\nits weight of manganese dioxide, the oxygen is given off at a much lower\ntemperature. Just how the manganese dioxide brings about this result is\nnot definitely known. The amount of oxygen obtained from a given weight\nof potassium chlorate is exactly the same whether the manganese dioxide\nis present or not. So far as can be detected the manganese dioxide\nundergoes no change.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 4]",
  "~Directions for preparing oxygen.~ The manner of preparing oxygen from\npotassium chlorate is illustrated in the accompanying diagram (Fig. 4).\nA mixture consisting of one part of manganese dioxide and four parts of\npotassium chlorate is placed in the flask A and gently heated. The\noxygen is evolved and escapes through the tube B. It is collected by\nbringing over the end of the tube the mouth of a bottle completely\nfilled with water and inverted in a vessel of water, as shown in the\nfigure. The gas rises in the bottle and displaces the water. In the\npreparation of large quantities of oxygen, a copper retort (Fig. 5) is\noften substituted for the glass flask.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 5]",
  "In the preparation of oxygen from potassium chlorate and manganese\ndioxide, the materials used must be pure, otherwise a violent explosion\nmay occur. The purity of the materials is tested by heating a small\namount of the mixture in a test tube.",
  "~The collection of gases.~ The method used for collecting oxygen\nillustrates the general method used for collecting such gases as are\ninsoluble in water or nearly so. The vessel C (Fig. 4), containing the\nwater in which the bottles are inverted, is called a _pneumatic trough._",
  "~Commercial methods of preparation.~ Oxygen can now be purchased stored\nunder great pressure in strong steel cylinders (Fig. 6). It is prepared\neither by heating a mixture of potassium chlorate and manganese dioxide,\nor by separating it from the nitrogen and other gases with which it is\nmixed in the atmosphere. The methods employed for effecting this\nseparation will be described in subsequent chapters.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 6]",
  "~Physical properties.~ Oxygen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless gas,\nslightly heavier than air. One liter of it, measured at a temperature of\n0° and under a pressure of one atmosphere, weighs 1.4285 g., while under\nsimilar conditions one liter of air weighs 1.2923 g. It is but slightly\nsoluble in water. Oxygen, like other gases, may be liquefied by applying\nvery great pressure to the highly cooled gas. When the pressure is\nremoved the liquid oxygen passes again into the gaseous state, since its\nboiling point under ordinary atmospheric pressure is -182.5°.",
  "~Chemical properties.~ At ordinary temperatures oxygen is not very active\nchemically. Most substances are either not at all affected by it, or the\naction is so slow as to escape notice. At higher temperatures, however,\nit is very active, and unites directly with most of the elements. This\nactivity may be shown by heating various substances until just ignited\nand then bringing them into vessels of the gas, when they will burn with\ngreat brilliancy. Thus a glowing splint introduced into a jar of oxygen\nbursts into flame. Sulphur burns in the air with a very weak flame and\nfeeble light; in oxygen, however, the flame is increased in size and\nbrightness. Substances which readily burn in air, such as phosphorus,\nburn in oxygen with dazzling brilliancy. Even substances which burn in\nair with great difficulty, such as iron, readily burn in oxygen.",
  "The burning of a substance in oxygen is due to the rapid combination of\nthe substance or of the elements composing it with the oxygen. Thus,\nwhen sulphur burns both the oxygen and sulphur disappear as such and\nthere is formed a compound of the two, which is an invisible gas, having\nthe characteristic odor of burning sulphur. Similarly, phosphorus on\nburning forms a white solid compound of phosphorus and oxygen, while\niron forms a reddish-black compound of iron and oxygen.",
  "~Oxidation.~ The term _oxidation_ is applied to the chemical change which\ntakes place when a substance, or one of its constituent parts, combines\nwith oxygen. This process may take place rapidly, as in the burning of\nphosphorus, or slowly, as in the oxidation (or rusting) of iron when\nexposed to the air. It is always accompanied by the liberation of heat.\nThe amount of heat liberated by the oxidation of a definite weight of\nany given substance is always the same, being entirely independent of\nthe rapidity of the process. If the oxidation takes place slowly, the\nheat is generated so slowly that it is difficult to detect it. If the\noxidation takes place rapidly, however, the heat is generated in such a\nshort interval of time that the substance may become white hot or burst\ninto a flame.",
  "~Combustion; kindling temperature.~ When oxidation takes place so rapidly\nthat the heat generated is sufficient to cause the substance to glow or\nburst into a flame the process is called _combustion_. In order that any\nsubstance may undergo combustion, it is necessary that it should be\nheated to a certain temperature, known as the _kindling temperature._\nThis temperature varies widely for different bodies, but is always\ndefinite for the same body. Thus the kindling temperature of phosphorus\nis far lower than that of iron, but is definite for each. When any\nportion of a substance is heated until it begins to burn the combustion\nwill continue without the further application of heat, provided the heat\ngenerated by the process is sufficient to bring other parts of the\nsubstance to the kindling temperature. On the other hand, if the heat\ngenerated is not sufficient to maintain the kindling temperature,\ncombustion ceases.",
  "~Oxides.~ The compounds formed by the oxidation of any element are called\n_oxides_. Thus in the combustion of sulphur, phosphorus, and iron, the\ncompounds formed are called respectively oxide of sulphur, oxide of\nphosphorus, and oxide of iron. In general, then, _an oxide is a compound\nof oxygen with another element_. A great many substances of this class\nare known; in fact, the oxides of all the common elements have been\nprepared, with the exception of those of fluorine and bromine. Some of\nthese are familiar compounds. Water, for example, is an oxide of\nhydrogen, and lime an oxide of the metal calcium.",
  "~Products of combustion.~ The particular oxides formed by the combustion\nof any substance are called _products of combustion_ of that substance.\nThus oxide of sulphur is the product of the combustion of sulphur; oxide\nof iron is the product of the combustion of iron. It is evident that the\nproducts of the combustion of any substance must weigh more than the\noriginal substance, the increase in weight corresponding to the amount\nof oxygen taken up in the act of combustion. For example, when iron\nburns the oxide of iron formed weighs more than the original iron.",
  "In some cases the products of combustion are invisible gases, so that\nthe substance undergoing combustion is apparently destroyed. Thus, when\na candle burns it is consumed, and so far as the eye can judge nothing\nis formed during combustion. That invisible gases are formed, however,\nand that the weight of these is greater than the weight of the candle\nmay be shown by the following experiment.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 7]",
  "A lamp chimney is filled with sticks of the compound known as\n     sodium hydroxide (caustic soda), and suspended from the beam of\n     the balance, as shown in Fig. 7. A piece of candle is placed on\n     the balance pan so that the wick comes just below the chimney,\n     and the balance is brought to a level by adding weights to the\n     other pan. The candle is then lighted. The products formed pass\n     up through the chimney and are absorbed by the sodium\n     hydroxide. Although the candle burns away, the pan upon which\n     it rests slowly sinks, showing that the combustion is attended\n     by an increase in weight.",
  "~Combustion in air and in oxygen.~ Combustion in air and in\n     oxygen differs only in rapidity, the products formed being\n     exactly the same. That the process should take place less\n     rapidly in the former is readily understood, for the air is\n     only about one fifth oxygen, the remaining four fifths being\n     inert gases. Not only is less oxygen available, but much of the\n     heat is absorbed in raising the temperature of the inert gases\n     surrounding the substance undergoing combustion, and the\n     temperature reached in the combustion is therefore less.",
  "~Phlogiston theory of combustion.~ The French chemist Lavoisier\n     (1743-1794), who gave to oxygen its name was the first to show\n     that combustion is due to union with oxygen. Previous to his\n     time combustion was supposed to be due to the presence of a\n     substance or principle called _phlogiston_. One substance was\n     thought to be more combustible than another because it\n     contained more phlogiston. Coal, for example, was thought to be\n     very rich in phlogiston. The ashes left after combustion would\n     not burn because all the phlogiston had escaped. If the\n     phlogiston could be restored in any way, the substance would\n     then become combustible again. Although this view seems absurd\n     to us in the light of our present knowledge, it formerly had\n     general acceptance. The discovery of oxygen led Lavoisier to\n     investigate the subject, and through his experiments he arrived\n     at the true explanation of combustion. The discovery of oxygen\n     together with the part it plays in combustion is generally\n     regarded as the most important discovery in the history of\n     chemistry. It marked the dawn of a new period in the growth of\n     the science.",
  "~Combustion in the broad sense.~ According to the definition given above,\nthe presence of oxygen is necessary for combustion. The term is\nsometimes used, however, in a broader sense to designate any chemical\nchange attended by the evolution of heat and light. Thus iron and\nsulphur, or hydrogen and chlorine under certain conditions, will combine\nso rapidly that light is evolved, and the action is called a combustion.\nWhenever combustion takes place in the air, however, the process is one\nof oxidation.",
  "~Spontaneous combustion.~ The temperature reached in a given\n     chemical action, such as oxidation, depends upon the rate at\n     which the reaction takes place. This rate is usually increased\n     by raising the temperature of the substances taking part in the\n     action.",
  "When a slow oxidation takes place under such conditions that\n     the heat generated is not lost by being conducted away, the\n     temperature of the substance undergoing oxidation is raised,\n     and this in turn hastens the rate of oxidation. The rise in\n     temperature may continue in this way until the kindling\n     temperature of the substance is reached, when combustion\n     begins. Combustion occurring in this way is called _spontaneous\n     combustion_.",
  "Certain oils, such as the linseed oil used in paints, slowly\n     undergo oxidation at ordinary temperatures, and not\n     infrequently the origin of fires has been traced to the\n     spontaneous combustion of oily rags. The spontaneous combustion\n     of hay has been known to set barns on fire. Heaps of coal have\n     been found to be on fire when spontaneous combustion offered\n     the only possible explanation.",
  "~Importance of oxygen.~ 1. Oxygen is essential to life. Among living\norganisms only certain minute forms of plant life can exist without it.\nIn the process of respiration the air is taken into the lungs where a\ncertain amount of oxygen is absorbed by the blood. It is then carried to\nall parts of the body, oxidizing the worn-out tissues and changing them\ninto substances which may readily be eliminated from the body. The heat\ngenerated by this oxidation is the source of the heat of the body. The\nsmall amount of oxygen which water dissolves from the air supports all\nthe varied forms of aquatic animals.",
  "2. Oxygen is also essential to decay. The process of decay is really a\nkind of oxidation, but it will only take place in the presence of\ncertain minute forms of life known as bacteria. Just how these assist in\nthe oxidation is not known. By this process the dead products of animal\nand vegetable life which collect on the surface of the earth are slowly\noxidized and so converted into harmless substances. In this way oxygen\nacts as a great purifying agent.",
  "3. Oxygen is also used in the treatment of certain diseases in which the\npatient is unable to inhale sufficient air to supply the necessary\namount of oxygen.",
  "OZONE",
  "~Preparation.~ When electric sparks are passed through oxygen or air a\nsmall percentage of the oxygen is converted into a substance called\n_ozone_, which differs greatly from oxygen in its properties. The same\nchange can also be brought about by certain chemical processes. Thus, if\nsome pieces of phosphorus are placed in a bottle and partially covered\nwith water, the presence of ozone may soon be detected in the air\ncontained in the bottle. The conversion of oxygen into ozone is attended\nby a change in volume, 3 volumes of oxygen forming 2 volumes of ozone.\nIf the resulting ozone is heated to about 300°, the reverse change\ntakes place, the 2 volumes of ozone being changed back into 3 volumes of\noxygen. It is possible that traces of ozone exist in the atmosphere,\nalthough its presence there has not been definitely proved, the tests\nformerly used for its detection having been shown to be unreliable.",
  "~Properties.~ As commonly prepared, ozone is mixed with a large excess of\noxygen. It is possible, however, to separate the ozone and thus obtain\nit in pure form. The gas so obtained has the characteristic odor noticed\nabout electrical machines when in operation. By subjecting it to great\npressure and a low temperature, the gas condenses to a bluish liquid,\nboiling at -119°. When unmixed with other gases ozone is very explosive,\nchanging back into oxygen with the liberation of heat. Its chemical\nproperties are similar to those of oxygen except that it is far more\nactive. Air or oxygen containing a small amount of ozone is now used in\nplace of oxygen in certain manufacturing processes.",
  "~The difference between oxygen and ozone.~ Experiments show that in\nchanging oxygen into ozone no other kind of matter is either added to\nthe oxygen or withdrawn from it. The question arises then, How can we\naccount for the difference in their properties? It must be remembered\nthat in all changes we have to take into account _energy_ as well as\n_matter_. By changing the amount of energy in a substance we change its\nproperties. That oxygen and ozone contain different amounts of energy\nmay be shown in a number of ways; for example, by the fact that the\nconversion of ozone into oxygen is attended by the liberation of heat.\nThe passage of the electric sparks through oxygen has in some way\nchanged the energy content of the element and thus it has acquired new\nproperties. _Oxygen and ozone must, therefore, be regarded as identical\nso far as the kind of matter of which they are composed is concerned.\nTheir different properties are due to their different energy contents._",
  "~Allotropic states or forms of matter.~ Other elements besides oxygen may\nexist in more than one form. These different forms of the same element\nare called _allotropic states_ or _forms_ of the element. These forms\ndiffer not only in physical properties but also in their energy\ncontents. Elements often exist in a variety of forms which look quite\ndifferent. These differences may be due to accidental causes, such as\nthe size or shape of the particles or the way in which the element was\nprepared. Only such forms, however, as have different energy contents\nare properly called allotropic forms.",
  "MEASUREMENT OF GAS VOLUMES",
  "~Standard conditions.~ It is a well-known fact that the volume occupied by\na definite weight of any gas can be altered by changing the temperature\nof the gas or the pressure to which it is subjected. In measuring the\nvolume of gases it is therefore necessary, for the sake of accuracy, to\nadopt some standard conditions of temperature and pressure. The\nconditions agreed upon are (1) a temperature of 0°, and (2) a pressure\nequal to the average pressure exerted by the atmosphere at the sea\nlevel, that is, 1033.3 g. per square centimeter. These conditions of\ntemperature and pressure are known as the _standard conditions_, and\nwhen the volume of a gas is given it is understood that the measurement\nwas made under these conditions, unless it is expressly stated\notherwise. For example, the weight of a liter of oxygen has been given\nas 1.4285 g. This means that one liter of oxygen, measured at a\ntemperature of 0° and under a pressure of 1033.3 g. per square\ncentimeter, weighs 1.4285 g.",
  "The conditions which prevail in the laboratory are never the standard\nconditions. It becomes necessary, therefore, to find a way to calculate\nthe volume which a gas will occupy under standard conditions from the\nvolume which it occupies under any other conditions. This may be done in\naccordance with the following laws.",
  "~Law of Charles.~ This law expresses the effect which a change in the\ntemperature of a gas has upon its volume. It may be stated as follows:\n_For every degree the temperature of a gas rises above zero the volume\nof the gas is increased by 1/273 of the volume which it occupies at\nzero; likewise for every degree the temperature of the gas falls below\nzero the volume of the gas is decreased by 1/273 of the volume which it\noccupies at zero, provided in both cases that the pressure to which the\ngas is subjected remains constant._",
  "If V represents the volume of gas at 0°, then the volume at 1° will be\nV + 1/273 V; at 2° it will be V + 2/273 V; or, in general, the\nvolume v, at the temperature t, will be expressed by the formula",
  "(1) v = V + t/273 V,",
  "or (2) v = V(1 + (t/273)).",
  "Since 1/273 = 0.00366, the formula may be written",
  "(3) v = V(1 + 0.00366t).",
  "Since the value of V (volume under standard conditions) is the one\nusually sought, it is convenient to transpose the equation to the\nfollowing form:",
  "(4) V = v/(1 + 0.00366t).",
  "The following problem will serve as an illustration of the application\nof this equation.",
  "The volume of a gas at 20° is 750 cc.; find the volume it will occupy at\n0°, the pressure remaining constant.",
  "In this case, v = 750 cc. and t = 20. By substituting these values,\nequation (4) becomes",
  "V = 750/(1 + 0.00366 × 20) = 698.9 cc.",
  "~Law of Boyle.~ This law expresses the relation between the volume\noccupied by a gas and the pressure to which it is subjected. It may be\nstated as follows: _The volume of a gas is inversely proportional to the\npressure under which it is measured, provided the temperature of the gas\nremains constant._",
  "If V represents the volume when subjected to a pressure P and v\nrepresents its volume when the pressure is changed to p, then, in\naccordance with the above law, V : v :: p : P, or VP = vp.\nIn other words, for a given weight of a gas the product of the numbers\nrepresenting its volume and the pressure to which it is subjected is a\nconstant.",
  "Since the pressure of the atmosphere at any point is indicated by the\nbarometric reading, it is convenient in the solution of the problems to\nsubstitute the latter for the pressure measured in grams per square\ncentimeter. The average reading of the barometer at the sea level is 760\nmm., which corresponds to a pressure of 1033.3 g. per square centimeter.\nThe following problem will serve as an illustration of the application\nof Boyle's law.",
  "A gas occupies a volume of 500 cc. in a laboratory where the barometric\nreading is 740 mm. What volume would it occupy if the atmospheric\npressure changed so that the reading became 750 mm.?",
  "Substituting the values in the equation VP = vp, we have 500 × 740 =\nv × 750, or v = 493.3 cc.",
  "~Variations in the volume of a gas due to changes both in temperature and\npressure.~ Inasmuch as corrections must be made as a rule for both\ntemperature and pressure, it is convenient to combine the equations\ngiven above for the corrections for each, so that the two corrections\nmay be made in one operation. The following equation is thus obtained:",
  "(5) V_{s} = vp/(760(1 + 0.00366t)),",
  "in which V_{s} represents the volume of a gas under standard\nconditions and v, p, and t the volume, pressure, and temperature\nrespectively at which the gas was actually measured.",
  "The following problem will serve to illustrate the application of this\nequation.",
  "A gas having a temperature of 20° occupies a volume of 500 cc. when\nsubjected to a pressure indicated by a barometric reading of 740 mm.\nWhat volume would this gas occupy under standard conditions?",
  "In this problem v = 500, p = 740, and t = 20. Substituting these\nvalues in the above equation, we get",
  "V_{s} = (500 × 740)/(760 (1 + 0.00366 × 20)) = 453.6 cc.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 8]",
  "~Variations in the volume of a gas due to the pressure of aqueous vapor.~\nIn many cases gases are collected over water, as explained under the\npreparation of oxygen. In such cases there is present in the gas a\ncertain amount of water vapor. This vapor exerts a definite pressure,\nwhich acts in opposition to the atmospheric pressure and which therefore\nmust be subtracted from the latter in determining the effective pressure\nupon the gas. Thus, suppose we wish to determine the pressure to which\nthe gas in tube A (Fig. 8) is subjected. The tube is raised or lowered\nuntil the level of the water inside and outside the tube is the same.\nThe atmosphere presses down upon the surface of the water (as indicated\nby the arrows), thus forcing the water upward within the tube with a\npressure equal to the atmospheric pressure. The full force of this\nupward pressure, however, is not spent in compressing the gas within the\ntube, for since it is collected over water it contains a certain amount\nof water vapor. This water vapor exerts a pressure (as indicated by the\narrow within the tube) in opposition to the upward pressure. It is\nplain, therefore, that the effective pressure upon the gas is equal to\nthe atmospheric pressure less the pressure exerted by the aqueous vapor.\nThe pressure exerted by the aqueous vapor increases with the\ntemperature. The figures representing the extent of this pressure (often\ncalled the _tension of aqueous vapor_) are given in the Appendix. They\nexpress the pressure or tension in millimeters of mercury, just as the\natmospheric pressure is expressed in millimeters of mercury.\nRepresenting the pressure of the aqueous vapor by a, formula (5)\nbecomes",

  "The pressure exerted by the aqueous vapor at 20° (see table in Appendix)\nis equal to the pressure exerted by a column of mercury 17.4 mm. in\nheight. Substituting the values of v, t, p, and a in formula\n(6), we have",
  "(6) V_{s} = 500(740 - 17.4)/(760(1 + 0.00366 × 20)) = 442.9 cc.",
  "~Adjustment of tubes before reading gas volumes.~ In measuring the volumes\nof gases collected in graduated tubes or other receivers, over a liquid\nas illustrated in Fig. 8, the reading should be taken after raising or\nlowering the tube containing the gas until the level of the liquid\ninside and outside the tube is the same; for it is only under these\nconditions that the upward pressure within the tube is the same as the\natmospheric pressure.",

  "HYDROGEN",
  "~Historical.~ The element hydrogen was first clearly recognized as a\ndistinct substance by the English investigator Cavendish, who in 1766\nobtained it in a pure state, and showed it to be different from the\nother inflammable airs or gases which had long been known. Lavoisier\ngave it the name hydrogen, signifying water former, since it had been\nfound to be a constituent of water.",
  "~Occurrence.~ In the free state hydrogen is found in the atmosphere, but\nonly in traces. In the combined state it is widely distributed, being a\nconstituent of water as well as of all living organisms, and the\nproducts derived from them, such as starch and sugar. About 10% of the\nhuman body is hydrogen. Combined with carbon, it forms the substances\nwhich constitute petroleum and natural gas.",
  "It is an interesting fact that while hydrogen in the free state\n     occurs only in traces on the earth, it occurs in enormous\n     quantities in the gaseous matter surrounding the sun and\n     certain other stars.",
  "~Preparation from water.~ Hydrogen can be prepared from water by several\nmethods, the most important of which are the following.",
  "1. _By the electric current._ As has been indicated in the preparation\nof oxygen, water is easily separated into its constituents, hydrogen and\noxygen, by passing an electric current through it under certain\nconditions.",
  "2. _By the action of certain metals._ When brought into contact with\ncertain metals under appropriate conditions, water gives up a portion\nor the whole of its hydrogen, its place being taken by the metal. In the\ncase of a few of the metals this change occurs at ordinary temperatures.\nThus, if a bit of sodium is thrown on water, an action is seen to take\nplace at once, sufficient heat being generated to melt the sodium, which\nruns about on the surface of the water. The change which takes place\nconsists in the displacement of one half of the hydrogen of the water by\nthe sodium, and may be represented as follows:",
  "_        _            _        _\n         | hydrogen |          | sodium   |\nsodium + | hydrogen |(water) = | hydrogen |(sodium hydroxide) + hydrogen\n         |_oxygen  _|          |_oxygen  _|",
  "The sodium hydroxide formed is a white solid which remains dissolved in\nthe undecomposed water, and may be obtained by evaporating the solution\nto dryness. The hydrogen is evolved as a gas and may be collected by\nsuitable apparatus.",
  "Other metals, such as magnesium and iron, decompose water rapidly, but\nonly at higher temperatures. When steam is passed over hot iron, for\nexample, the iron combines with the oxygen of the steam, thus displacing\nthe hydrogen. Experiments show that the change may be represented as\nfollows:",
  "_        _\n       | hydrogen |           _       _                 _        _\niron + | hydrogen |(water) = | iron    |(iron oxide) + | hydrogen |\n       |_oxygen  _|          |_oxygen _|               |_hydrogen_|",
  "The iron oxide formed is a reddish-black compound, identical with that\nobtained by the combustion of iron in oxygen.",
  "~Directions for preparing hydrogen by the action of steam on\n     iron.~ The apparatus used in the preparation of hydrogen from\n     iron and steam is shown in Fig. 9. A porcelain or iron tube\n     B, about 50 cm. in length and 2 cm. or 3 cm. in diameter, is\n     partially filled with fine iron wire or tacks and connected as\n     shown in the figure. The tube B is heated, slowly at first,\n     until the iron is red-hot. Steam is then conducted through the\n     tube by boiling the water in the flask A. The hot iron\n     combines with the oxygen in the steam, setting free the\n     hydrogen, which is collected over water. The gas which first\n     passes over is mixed with the air previously contained in the\n     flask and tube, and is allowed to escape, _since a mixture of\n     hydrogen with oxygen or air explodes violently when brought in\n     contact with a flame_. It is evident that the flask A must be\n     disconnected from the tube before the heat is withdrawn.",
  "That the gas obtained is different from air and oxygen may be\n     shown by holding a bottle of it mouth downward and bringing a\n     lighted splint into it. The hydrogen is ignited and burns with\n     an almost colorless flame.",
  "[Illustration Fig. 9]",
  "~Preparation from acids~ (_usual laboratory method_). While hydrogen can\nbe prepared from water, either by the action of the electric current or\nby the action of certain metals, these methods are not economical and\nare therefore but little used. In the laboratory hydrogen is generally\nprepared from compounds known as acids, all of which contain hydrogen.\nWhen acids are brought in contact with certain metals, the metals\ndissolve and set free the hydrogen of the acid. Although this reaction\nis a quite general one, it has been found most convenient in preparing\nhydrogen by this method to use either zinc or iron as the metal and\neither hydrochloric or sulphuric acid as the acid. Hydrochloric acid is\na compound consisting of 2.77% hydrogen and 97.23% chlorine, while\nsulphuric acid consists of 2.05% hydrogen, 32.70% sulphur, and 65.25%\noxygen.",
  "The changes which take place in the preparation of hydrogen from zinc\nand sulphuric acid (diluted with water) may be represented as follows:",
  "_        _               _       _\n       | hydrogen |(sulphuric   | zinc    |(zinc\nzinc + | sulphur  | acid)     = | sulphur | sulphate) + hydrogen\n       |_oxygen  _|             |_oxygen _|",
  "In other words, the zinc has taken the place of the hydrogen in\nsulphuric acid. The resulting compound contains zinc, sulphur, and\noxygen, and is known as zinc sulphate. This remains dissolved in the\nwater present in the acid. It may be obtained in the form of a white\nsolid by evaporating the liquid left after the metal has passed into\nsolution.",
  "When zinc and hydrochloric acid are used the following changes take\nplace:",
  "_        _                  _        _\n       | hydrogen |(hydrochloric   | zinc     |(zinc\nzinc + |_chlorine_| acid)        = |_chlorine_| chloride) + hydrogen",
  "When iron is used the changes which take place are exactly similar to\nthose just given for zinc.",
  "[Illustration Fig. 10.]",
  "~Directions for preparing hydrogen from acids.~ The preparation\n     of hydrogen from acids is carried out in the laboratory as\n     follows: The metal is placed in a flask or wide-mouthed bottle\n     A (Fig. 10) and the acid is added slowly through the funnel\n     tube B. The metal dissolves in the acid, while the hydrogen\n     which is liberated escapes through the exit tube C and is\n     collected over water. It is evident that the hydrogen which\n     passes over first is mixed with the air from the bottle A.\n     Hence care must be taken not to bring a flame near the exit\n     tube, since, as has been stated previously, such a mixture\n     explodes with great violence when brought in contact with a\n     flame.",
  "~Precautions.~ Both sulphuric acid and zinc, if impure, are\n     likely to contain small amounts of arsenic. Such materials\n     should not be used in preparing hydrogen, since the arsenic\n     present combines with a portion of the hydrogen to form a very\n     poisonous gas known as arsine. On the other hand, chemically\n     pure sulphuric acid, i.e. sulphuric acid that is entirely free\n     from impurities, will not act upon chemically pure zinc. The\n     reaction may be started, however, by the addition of a few\n     drops of a solution of copper sulphate or platinum\n     tetrachloride.",
  "~Physical properties.~ Hydrogen is similar to oxygen in that it is a\ncolorless, tasteless, odorless gas. It is characterized by its extreme\nlightness, being the lightest of all known substances. One liter of the\ngas weighs only 0.08984 g. On comparing this weight with that of an\nequal volume of oxygen, viz., 1.4285 g., the latter is found to be 15.88\ntimes as heavy as hydrogen. Similarly, air is found to be 14.38 times as\nheavy as hydrogen. Soap bubbles blown with hydrogen rapidly rise in the\nair. On account of its lightness it is possible to pour it upward from\none bottle into another. Thus, if the bottle A (Fig. 11) is filled\nwith hydrogen, placed mouth downward by the side of bottle _B_, filled\nwith air, and is then gradually inverted under B as indicated in the\nfigure, the hydrogen will flow upward into bottle _B_, displacing the\nair. Its presence in bottle B may then be shown by bringing a lighted\nsplint to the mouth of the bottle, when the hydrogen will be ignited by\nthe flame. It is evident, from this experiment, that in order to retain\nthe gas in an open bottle the bottle must be placed mouth downward.",
  "[Illustration Fig. 11]",
  "Hydrogen is far more difficult to liquefy than any other gas, with the\nexception of helium, a rare element recently found to exist in the\natmosphere. The English scientist Dewar, however, in 1898 succeeded not\nonly in obtaining hydrogen in liquid state but also as a solid. Liquid\nhydrogen is colorless and has a density of only 0.07. Its boiling point\nunder atmospheric pressure is -252°. Under diminished pressure the\ntemperature has been reduced to -262°. The solubility of hydrogen in\nwater is very slight, being still less than that of oxygen.",
  "Pure hydrogen produces no injurious results when inhaled. Of course one\ncould not live in an atmosphere of the gas, since oxygen is essential to\nrespiration.",
  "~Chemical properties.~ At ordinary temperatures hydrogen is not an active\nelement. A mixture of hydrogen and chlorine, however, will combine with\nexplosive violence at ordinary temperature if exposed to the sunlight.\nThe union can be brought about also by heating. The product formed in\neither case is hydrochloric acid. Under suitable conditions hydrogen\ncombines with nitrogen to form ammonia, and with sulphur to form the\nfoul-smelling gas, hydrogen sulphide. The affinity of hydrogen for\noxygen is so great that a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen or hydrogen\nand air explodes with great violence when heated to the kindling\ntemperature (about 612°). Nevertheless under proper conditions hydrogen\nmay be made to burn quietly in either oxygen or air. The resulting\nhydrogen flame is almost colorless and is very hot. The combustion of\nthe hydrogen is, of course, due to its union with oxygen. The product of\nthe combustion is therefore a compound of hydrogen and oxygen. That this\ncompound is water may be shown easily by experiment.",
  "[Illustration Fig. 12]",
  "~Directions for burning hydrogen in air.~ The combustion of\n     hydrogen in air may be carried out safely as follows: The\n     hydrogen is generated in the bottle A (Fig. 12), is dried by\n     conducting it through the tube X, filled with some substance\n     (generally calcium chloride) which has a great attraction for\n     moisture, and escapes through the tube T, the end of which is\n     drawn out to a jet. The hydrogen first liberated mixes with the\n     air contained in the generator. If a flame is brought near the\n     jet before this mixture has all escaped, a violent and very\n     dangerous explosion results, since the entire apparatus is\n     filled with the explosive mixture. On the other hand, if the\n     flame is not applied until all the air has been expelled, the\n     hydrogen is ignited and burns quietly, since only the small\n     amount of it which escapes from the jet can come in contact\n     with the oxygen of the air at any one time. By holding a cold,\n     dry bell jar or bottle over the flame, in the manner shown in\n     the figure, the steam formed by the combustion of the hydrogen\n     is condensed, the water collecting in drops on the sides of the\n     jar.",
  "~Precautions.~ In order to avoid danger it is absolutely necessary to\nprove that the hydrogen is free from air before igniting it. This can be\ndone by testing small amounts of the escaping gas. A convenient and safe\nmethod of doing this is to fill a test tube with the gas by inverting it\nover the jet. The hydrogen, on account of its lightness, collects in the\ntube, displacing the air. After holding it over the jet for a few\nmoments in order that it may be filled with the gas, the tube is gently\nbrought, mouth downward, to the flame of a burner placed not nearer than\nan arm's length from the jet. If the hydrogen is mixed with air a slight\nexplosion occurs, but if pure it burns quietly in the tube. The\noperation is repeated until the gas burns quietly, when the tube is\nquickly brought back over the jet for an instant, whereby the escaping\nhydrogen is ignited by the flame in the tube.",
  "[Illustration. Fig. 13]",
  "~A mixture of hydrogen and oxygen is explosive.~ That a mixture of\nhydrogen and air is explosive may be shown safely as follows: A cork\nthrough which passes a short glass tube about 1 cm. in diameter is\nfitted air-tight into the tubule of a bell jar of 2 l. or 3 l. capacity.\n(A thick glass bottle with bottom removed may be used.) The tube is\nclosed with a small rubber stopper and the bell jar filled with\nhydrogen, the gas being collected over water. When entirely filled with\nthe gas the jar is removed from the water and supported by blocks of\nwood in order to leave the bottom of the jar open, as shown in Fig. 13.\nThe stopper is now removed from the tube in the cork, and the hydrogen,\nwhich on account of its lightness escapes from the tube, is at once\nlighted. As the hydrogen escapes, the air flows in at the bottom of the\njar and mixes with the remaining portion of the hydrogen, so that a\nmixture of the two soon forms, and a loud explosion results. The\nexplosion is not dangerous, since the bottom of the jar is open, thus\nleaving room for the expansion of the hot gas.",
  "Since air is only one fifth oxygen, the remainder being inert gases, it\nmay readily be inferred that a mixture of hydrogen with pure oxygen\nwould be far more explosive than a mixture of hydrogen with air. Such\nmixtures should not be made except in small quantities and by\nexperienced workers.",
  "~Hydrogen does not support combustion.~ While hydrogen is readily\ncombustible, it is not a supporter of combustion. In other words,\nsubstances will not burn in it. This may be shown by bringing a lighted\ncandle supported by a stiff wire into a bottle or cylinder of the pure\ngas, as shown in Fig. 14. The hydrogen is ignited by the flame of the\ncandle and burns at the mouth of the bottle, where it comes in contact\nwith the oxygen in the air. When the candle is thrust up into the gas,\nits flame is extinguished on account of the absence of oxygen. If slowly\nwithdrawn, the candle is relighted as it passes through the layer of\nburning hydrogen.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 14]",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 15]",
  "~Reduction.~ On account of its great affinity for oxygen, hydrogen has the\npower of abstracting it from many of its compounds. Thus, if a stream of\nhydrogen, dried by passing through the tube B (Fig. 15), filled with\ncalcium chloride, is conducted through the tube C containing some\ncopper oxide, heated to a moderate temperature, the hydrogen abstracts\nthe oxygen from the copper oxide. The change may be represented as\nfollows:",
  "hydrogen + {copper}                 {hydrogen}\n                {oxygen}(copper oxide) = {oxygen  }(water) + copper",
  "The water formed collects in the cold portions of the tube C near its\nend. In this experiment the copper oxide is said to undergo reduction.\n_Reduction may therefore be defined as the process of withdrawing oxygen\nfrom a compound._",
  "~Relation of reduction to oxidation.~ At the same time that the copper\noxide is reduced it is clear that the hydrogen is oxidized, for it\ncombines with the oxygen given up by the copper oxide. The two processes\nare therefore very closely related, and it usually happens that when one\nsubstance is oxidized some other substance is reduced. That substance\nwhich gives up its oxygen is called an _oxidizing agent_, while the\nsubstance which unites with the oxygen is called a _reducing agent_.",
  "~The oxyhydrogen blowpipe.~ This is a form of apparatus used for burning\nhydrogen in pure oxygen. As has been previously stated, the flame\nproduced by the combustion of hydrogen in the air is very hot. It is\nevident that if pure oxygen is substituted for air, the temperature\nreached will be much higher, since there are no inert gases to absorb\nthe heat. The oxyhydrogen blowpipe, used to effect this combination,\nconsists of a small tube placed within a larger one, as shown in Fig.\n16.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 16]",
  "The hydrogen, stored under pressure, generally in steel cylinders, is\nfirst passed through the outer tube and ignited at the open end of the\ntube. The oxygen from a similar cylinder is then conducted through the\ninner tube, and mixes with the hydrogen at the end of the tube. In order\nto produce the maximum heat, the hydrogen and oxygen must be admitted to\nthe blowpipe in the exact proportion in which they combine, viz., 2\nvolumes of hydrogen to 1 of oxygen, or by weight, 1 part of hydrogen to\n7.94 parts of oxygen. The intensity of the heat may be shown by bringing\ninto the flame pieces of metal such as iron wire or zinc. These burn\nwith great brilliancy. Even platinum, having a melting point of 1779°,\nmay be melted by the heat of the flame.",
  "While the oxyhydrogen flame is intensely hot, it is almost non-luminous.\nIf directed against some infusible substance like ordinary lime (calcium\noxide), the heat is so intense that the lime becomes incandescent and\nglows with a brilliant light. This is sometimes used as a source of\nlight, under the name of _Drummond_ or _lime light_.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 17]",
  "~The blast lamp.~ A similar form of apparatus is commonly used in the\nlaboratory as a source of heat under the name _blast lamp_ (Fig. 17).\nThis differs from the oxyhydrogen blowpipe only in the size of the\ntubes. In place of the hydrogen and oxygen the more accessible coal gas\nand air are respectively used. The former is composed largely of a\nmixture of free hydrogen and gaseous compounds of carbon and hydrogen.\nWhile the temperature of the flame is not so high as that of the\noxyhydrogen blowpipe, it nevertheless suffices for most chemical\noperations carried out in the laboratory.",
  "~Uses of hydrogen.~ On account of its cost, hydrogen is but little used\nfor commercial purposes. It is sometimes used as a material for the\ninflation of balloons, but usually the much cheaper coal gas is\nsubstituted for it. Even hot air is often used when the duration of\nascension is very short. It has been used also as a source of heat and\nlight in the oxyhydrogen blowpipe. Where the electric current is\navailable, however, this form of apparatus has been displaced almost\nentirely by the electric light and electric furnace, which are much more\neconomical and more powerful sources of light and heat.",

  "COMPOUNDS OF HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN; WATER AND HYDROGEN DIOXIDE",
  "WATER",
  "~Historical.~ Water was long regarded as an element. In 1781 Cavendish\nshowed that it is formed by the union of hydrogen and oxygen. Being a\nbeliever in the phlogiston theory, however, he failed to interpret his\nresults correctly. A few years later Lavoisier repeated Cavendish's\nexperiments and showed that water must be regarded as a compound of\nhydrogen and oxygen.",
  "~General methods employed for the determination of the composition of a\ncompound.~ The composition of a compound may be determined by either of\ntwo general processes these are known as _analysis_ and _synthesis_.",
  "1. _Analysis_ is the process of decomposing a compound into its\nconstituents and determining what these constituents are. The analysis\nis _qualitative_ when it results in merely determining what elements\ncompose the compound; it is _quantitative_ when the exact percentage of\neach constituent is determined. Qualitative analysis must therefore\nprecede quantitative analysis, for it must be known what elements, are\nin a compound before a method can be devised for determining exactly how\nmuch of each is present.",
  "2. _Synthesis_ is the process of forming a compound from its constituent\nparts. It is therefore the reverse of analysis. Like analysis, it may be\neither qualitative or quantitative.",
  "~Application of these methods to the determination of the composition of\nwater.~ The determination of the composition of water is a matter of\ngreat interest not only because of the importance of the compound but\nalso because the methods employed illustrate the general methods of\nanalysis and synthesis.",
  "~Methods based on analysis.~ The methods based on analysis may be either\nqualitative or quantitative in character.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 18]",
  "1. _Qualitative analysis._ As was stated in the study of oxygen, water\nmay be separated into its component parts by means of the electric\ncurrent. The form of apparatus ordinarily used for effecting this\nanalysis is shown in Fig. 18. A platinum wire, to the end of which is\nattached a small piece of platinum foil (about 15 mm. by 25 mm.), is\nfused through each of the tubes B and D, as shown in the figure. The\nstopcocks at the ends of these tubes are opened and water, to which has\nbeen added about one tenth of its volume of sulphuric acid, is poured\ninto the tube A until the side tubes B and D are completely\nfilled. The stopcocks are then closed. The platinum wires extending into\nthe tubes B and D are now connected with the wires leading from two\nor three dichromate cells joined in series. The pieces of platinum foil\nwithin the tubes thus become the electrodes, and the current flows from\none to the other through the acidulated water. As soon as the current\npasses, bubbles of gas rise from each of the electrodes and collect in\nthe upper part of the tubes. The gas rising from the negative electrode\nis found to be hydrogen, while that from the positive electrode is\noxygen. It will be seen that the volume of the hydrogen is approximately\ndouble that of the oxygen. Oxygen is more soluble in water than\nhydrogen, and a very little of it is also lost by being converted into\nozone and other substances. It has been found that when the necessary\ncorrections are made for the error due to these facts, the volume of the\nhydrogen is exactly double that of the oxygen.",
  "Fig. 19 illustrates a simpler form of apparatus, which may be used in\nplace of that shown in Fig. 18. A glass or porcelain dish is partially\nfilled with water to which has been added the proper amount of acid. Two\ntubes filled with the same liquid are inverted over the electrodes. The\ngases resulting from the decomposition of the water collect in the\ntubes.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 19]",
  "2. _Quantitative analysis._ The analysis just described is purely\nqualitative and simply shows that water contains hydrogen and oxygen. It\ndoes not prove the absence of other elements; indeed it does not prove\nthat the hydrogen and oxygen are present in the proportion in which they\nare liberated by the electric current. The method may be made\nquantitative, however, by weighing the water decomposed and also the\nhydrogen and oxygen obtained in its decomposition. If the combined\nweights of the hydrogen and oxygen exactly equal the weight of the water\ndecomposed, then it would be proved that the water consists of hydrogen\nand oxygen in the proportion in which they are liberated by the electric\ncurrent. This experiment is difficult to carry out, however, so that the\nmore accurate methods based on synthesis are used.",
  "~Methods based on synthesis.~ Two steps are necessary to ascertain the\nexact composition of water by synthesis: (1) to show by qualitative\nsynthesis that water is formed by the union of oxygen with hydrogen; (2)\nto determine by quantitative synthesis in what proportion the two\nelements unite to form water. The fact that water is formed by the\ncombination of oxygen with hydrogen was proved in the preceding chapter.\nThe quantitative synthesis may be made as follows:",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 20]",
  "The combination of the two gases is brought about in a tube called a\neudiometer. This is a graduated tube about 60 cm. long and 2 cm. wide,\nclosed at one end (Fig. 20). Near the closed end two platinum wires are\nfused through the glass, the ends of the wires within the tube being\nseparated by a space of 2 mm or 3 mm. The tube is entirely filled with\nmercury and inverted in a vessel of the same liquid. Pure hydrogen is\npassed into the tube until it is about one fourth filled. The volume of\nthe gas is then read off on the scale and reduced to standard\nconditions. Approximately an equal volume of pure oxygen is then\nintroduced and the volume again read off and reduced to standard\nconditions. This gives the total volume of the two gases. From this the\nvolume of the oxygen introduced may be determined by subtracting from\nit the volume of the hydrogen. The combination of the two gases is now\nbrought about by connecting the two platinum wires with an induction\ncoil and passing a spark from one wire to the other. Immediately a\nslight explosion occurs. The mercury in the tube is at first depressed\nbecause of the expansion of the gases due to the heat generated, but at\nonce rebounds, taking the place of the gases which have combined to form\nwater. The volume of the water in the liquid state is so small that it\nmay be disregarded in the calculations. In order that the temperature of\nthe residual gas and the mercury may become uniform, the apparatus is\nallowed to stand for a few minutes. The volume of the gas is then read\noff and reduced to standard conditions, so that it may be compared with\nthe volumes of the hydrogen and oxygen originally taken. The residual\ngas is then tested in order to ascertain whether it is hydrogen or\noxygen, experiments having proved that it is never a mixture of the two.\nFrom the information thus obtained the composition of the water may be\ncalculated. Thus, suppose the readings were as follows:",

  "The 20.3 cc. of hydrogen have combined with 18.4 cc. minus 8.3 cc. (or\n10.1 cc.) of oxygen; or approximately 2 volumes of hydrogen have\ncombined with 1 of oxygen. Since oxygen is 15.88 times as heavy as\nhydrogen, the proportion by weight in which the two gases combine is 1\npart of hydrogen to 7.94 of oxygen.",
  "~Precaution.~ If the two gases are introduced into the eudiometer in the\nexact proportions in which they combine, after the combination has taken\nplace the liquid will rise and completely fill the tube. Under these\nconditions, however, the tube is very likely to be broken by the sudden\nupward rush of the liquid. Hence in performing the experiment care is\ntaken to introduce an excess of one of the gases.",
  "~A more convenient form of eudiometer.~ A form of eudiometer (Fig. 21)\ndifferent from that shown on page 43 is sometimes used to avoid the\ncalculations necessary in reducing the volumes of the gases to the same\nconditions of temperature and pressure in order to make comparisons.\nWith this apparatus it is possible to take the readings of the volumes\nunder the same conditions of temperature and pressure, and thus compare\nthem directly. The apparatus (Fig. 21) is filled with mercury and the\ngases introduced into the tube A. The experiment is carried out as in\nthe preceding one, except that before taking the reading of the gas\nvolumes, mercury is either added to the tube B or withdrawn from it by\nmeans of the stopcock C, until it stands at exactly the same height in\nboth tubes. The gas inclosed in tube A is then under atmospheric\npressure; and since but a few minutes are required for performing the\nexperiment, the conditions of temperature and pressure may be regarded\nas constant. Hence the volumes of the hydrogen and oxygen and of the\nresidual gas may be read off from the tube and directly compared.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 21]",
  "~Method used by Berzelius and Dumas.~ The method used by these\ninvestigators enables us to determine directly the proportion by weight\nin which the hydrogen and oxygen combine. Fig. 22 illustrates the\napparatus used in making this determination. B is a glass tube\ncontaining copper oxide. C and D are glass tubes filled with calcium\nchloride, a substance which has great affinity for water. The tubes B\nand C, including their contents, are carefully weighed, and the\napparatus connected as shown in the figure. A slow current of pure\nhydrogen is then passed through A, and that part of the tube B which\ncontains copper oxide is carefully heated. The hydrogen combines with\nthe oxygen present in the copper oxide to form water, which is absorbed\nby the calcium chloride in tube C. The calcium chloride in tube D\nprevents any moisture entering tube C from the air. The operation is\ncontinued until an appreciable amount of water has been formed. The\ntubes B and C are then weighed once more. The loss of weight in the\ntube B will exactly equal the weight of oxygen taken up from the\ncopper oxide in the formation of the water. The gain in weight in the\ntube C will exactly equal the weight of the water formed. The\ndifference in these weights will of course equal the weight of the\nhydrogen present in the water formed.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 22]",
  "~Dumas' results.~ The above method for the determination of the\ncomposition of water was first used by Berzelius in 1820. The work was\nrepeated in 1843 by Dumas, the average of whose results is as follows:",
  "Weight of water formed                  236.36 g.\nOxygen given up by the copper oxide     210.04\n                                        ------\nWeight of hydrogen present in water      26.32",
  "According to this experiment the ratio of hydrogen to oxygen in water is\ntherefore 26.32 to 210.04, or as l to 7.98",
  "~Morley's results.~ The American chemist Morley has recently determined\nthe composition of water, extreme precautions being taken to use pure\nmaterials and to eliminate all sources of error. The hydrogen and oxygen\nwhich combined, as well as the water formed, were all accurately\nweighed. According to Morley's results, 1 part of hydrogen by weight\ncombines with 7.94 parts of oxygen to form water.",
  "~Comparison of results obtained.~ From the above discussions it is easy to\nsee that it is by experiment alone that the composition of a compound\ncan be determined. Different methods may lead to slightly different\nresults. The more accurate the method chosen and the greater the skill\nwith which the experiment is carried out, the more accurate will be the\nresults. It is generally conceded by chemists that the results obtained\nby Morley in reference to the composition of water are the most accurate\nones. In accordance with these results, then, _water must be regarded as\na compound containing hydrogen and oxygen in the proportion of 1 part by\nweight of hydrogen to 7.94 parts by weight of oxygen_.",
  "~Relation between the volume of aqueous vapor and the volumes of the\nhydrogen and oxygen which combine to form it.~ When the quantitative\nsynthesis of water is carried out in the eudiometer as described above,\nthe water vapor formed by the union of the hydrogen and oxygen at once\ncondenses. The volume of the resulting liquid is so small that it may be\ndisregarded in making the calculations. If, however, the experiment is\ncarried out at a temperature of 100° or above, the water-vapor formed is\nnot condensed and it thus becomes possible to compare the volume of the\nvapor with the volumes of hydrogen and oxygen which combined to form it.\nThis can be accomplished by surrounding the arm A of the eudiometer\n(Fig. 23) with the tube B through which is passed the vapor obtained\nby boiling some liquid which has a boiling point above 100°. In this way\nit has been proved that 2 volumes of hydrogen and 1 volume of oxygen\ncombine to form exactly 2 volumes of water vapor, the volumes all being\nmeasured under the same conditions of temperature and pressure. It will\nbe noted that the relation between these volumes may be expressed by\nwhole numbers. The significance of this very important fact will be\ndiscussed in a subsequent chapter.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 23]",
  "~Occurrence of water.~ Water not only covers about three fourths of the\nsurface of the earth, and is present in the atmosphere in the form of\nmoisture, but it is also a common constituent of the soil and rocks and\nof almost every form of animal and vegetable organism. The human body is\nnearly 70% water. This is derived not only from the water which we drink\nbut also from the food which we eat, most of which contains a large\npercentage of water. Thus potatoes contain about 78% of water, milk 85%,\nbeef over 50%, apples 84%, tomatoes 94%.",
  "~Impurities in water.~ Chemically pure water contains only hydrogen and\noxygen. Such a water never occurs in nature, however, for being a good\nsolvent, it takes up certain substances from the rocks and soil with\nwhich it comes in contact. When such waters are evaporated these\nsubstances are deposited in the form of a residue. Even rain water,\nwhich is the purest form occurring in nature, contains dust particles\nand gases dissolved from the atmosphere. The foreign matter in water is\nof two kinds, namely, _mineral_, such as common salt and limestone, and\n_organic_, that is the products of animal and vegetable life.",
  "~Mineral matter in water.~ The amount and nature of the mineral\n     matter present in different waters vary greatly, depending on\n     the character of the rocks and soil with which the waters come\n     in contact. The more common of the substances present are\n     common salt and compounds of calcium, magnesium, and iron. One\n     liter of the average river water contains about 175 mg. of\n     mineral matter. Water from deep wells naturally contains more\n     mineral matter than river water, generally two or three times\n     as much, while sea water contains as much as 35,000 mg. to the\n     liter.",
  "~Effect of impurities on health.~ The mineral matter in water does not,\nsave in very exceptional cases, render the water injurious to the human\nsystem. In fact the presence of a certain amount of such matter is\nadvantageous, supplying the mineral constituents necessary for the\nformation of the solid tissues of the body. The presence of organic\nmatter, on the other hand, must always be regarded with suspicion. This\norganic matter may consist not only of the products of animal and\nvegetable life but also of certain microscopic forms of living organisms\nwhich are likely to accompany such products. Contagious diseases are\nknown to be due to the presence in the body of minute living organisms\nor germs. Each disease is caused by its own particular kind of germ.\nThrough sewage these germs may find their way from persons afflicted\nwith disease into the water supply, and it is principally through the\ndrinking water that certain of these diseases, especially typhoid fever,\nare spread. It becomes of great importance, therefore, to be able to\ndetect such matter when present in drinking water as well as to devise\nmethods whereby it can be removed or at least rendered harmless.",
  "~Analysis of water.~ The mineral analysis of a water is, as the\n     name suggests, simply the determination of the mineral matter\n     present. Sanitary analysis, on the other hand, is the\n     determination of the organic matter present. The physical\n     properties of a water give no conclusive evidence as to its\n     purity, since a water may be unfit for drinking purposes and\n     yet be perfectly clear and odorless. Neither can any reliance\n     be placed on the simple methods often given for testing the\n     purity of water. Only the trained chemist can carry out such\n     methods of analysis as can be relied upon.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 24]",
  "~Purification of water.~ Three general methods are used for the\npurification of water, namely, _distillation_, _filtration_, and\n_boiling_.",
  "1. _Distillation._ The most effective way of purifying natural waters is\nby the process of distillation. This consists in boiling the water and\ncondensing the steam. Fig. 24 illustrates the process of distillation,\nas commonly conducted in the laboratory. Ordinary water is poured into\nthe flask A and boiled. The steam is conducted through the condenser\nB, which consists essentially of a narrow glass tube sealed within a\nlarger one, the space between the two being filled with cold water,\nwhich is admitted at C and escapes at D. The inner tube is thus kept\ncool and the steam in passing through it is condensed. The water formed\nby the condensation of the steam collects in the receiver E and is\nknown as _distilled_ water. Such water is practically pure, since the\nimpurities are nonvolatile and remain in the flask A.",
  "~Commercial distillation.~ In preparing distilled water on a\n     large scale, the steam is generated in a boiler or other metal\n     container and condensed by passing it through a pipe made of\n     metal, generally tin. This pipe is wound into a spiral and is\n     surrounded by a current of cold water. Distilled water is used\n     by the chemist in almost all of his work. It is also used in\n     the manufacture of artificial ice and for drinking water.",
  "~Fractional distillation.~ In preparing distilled water, it is\n     evident that if the natural water contains some substance which\n     is volatile its vapor will pass over and be condensed with the\n     steam, so that the distillate will not be pure water. Even such\n     mixtures, however, may generally be separated by repeated\n     distillation. Thus, if a mixture of water (boiling point 100°)\n     and alcohol (boiling point 78°) is distilled, the alcohol,\n     having the lower boiling point, tends to distill first,\n     followed by the water. The separation of the two is not\n     perfect, however, but may be made nearly so by repeated\n     distillations. The process of separating a mixture of volatile\n     substances by distillation is known as _fractional\n     distillation_.",
  "2. _Filtration._ The process of distillation practically removes all\nnonvolatile foreign matter, mineral as well as organic. In purifying\nwater for drinking purposes, however, it is only necessary to eliminate\nthe latter or to render it harmless. This is ordinarily done either by\nfiltration or boiling. In filtration the water is passed through some\nmedium which will retain the organic matter. Ordinary charcoal is a\nporous substance and will condense within its pores the organic matter\nin water if brought in contact with it. It is therefore well adapted to\nthe construction of filters. Such filters to be effective must be kept\nclean, since it is evident that the charcoal is useless after its pores\nare filled. A more effective type of filter is the Chamberlain-Pasteur\nfilter. In this the water is forced through a porous cylindrical cup,\nthe pores being so minute as to strain out the organic matter.",
  "~City filtration beds.~ For purifying the water supply of cities,\n     large filtration beds are prepared from sand and gravel, and\n     the water is allowed to filter through these. Some of the\n     impurities are strained out by the filter, while others are\n     decomposed by the action of certain kinds of bacteria present\n     in the sand. Fig. 25 shows a cross section of a portion of the\n     filter used in purifying the water supply of Philadelphia. The\n     water filters through the sand and gravel and passes into the\n     porous pipe A, from which it is pumped into the city mains.\n     The filters are covered to prevent the water from freezing in\n     cold weather.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 25]",
  "3. _Boiling._ A simpler and equally efficient method for purifying water\nfor drinking purposes consists in boiling the water. It is the germs in\nwater that render it dangerous to health. These germs are living forms\nof matter. If the water is boiled, the germs are killed and the water\nrendered safe. While these germs are destroyed by heat, cold has little\neffect upon them. Thus Dewar, in working with liquid hydrogen, exposed\nsome of these minute forms of life to the temperature of boiling\nhydrogen (-252°) without killing them.",
  "~Self-purification of water.~ It has long been known that water\ncontaminated with organic matter tends to purify itself when exposed to\nthe air. This is due to the fact that the water takes up a small amount\nof oxygen from the air, which gradually oxidizes the organic matter\npresent in the water. While water is undoubtedly purified in this way,\nthe method cannot be relied upon to purify a contaminated water so as to\nrender it safe for drinking purposes.",
  "~Physical properties.~ Pure water is an odorless and tasteless liquid,\ncolorless in thin layers, but having a bluish tinge when observed\nthrough a considerable thickness. It solidifies at 0° and boils at 100°\nunder the normal pressure of one atmosphere. If the pressure is\nincreased, the boiling point is raised. When water is cooled it steadily\ncontracts until the temperature of 4° is reached: it then expands. Water\nis remarkable for its ability to dissolve other substances, and is the\nbest solvent known. Solutions of solids in water are more frequently\nemployed in chemical work than are the solid substances, for chemical\naction between substances goes on more readily when they are in solution\nthan it does when they are in the solid state.",
  "~Chemical properties.~ Water is a very stable substance, or, in other\nwords, it does not undergo decomposition readily. To decompose it into\nits elements by heat alone requires a very high temperature; at 2500°,\nfor example, only about 5% of the entire amount is decomposed. Though\nvery stable towards heat, water can be decomposed in other ways, as by\nthe action of the electrical current or by certain metals.",
  "~Heat of formation and heat of decomposition are equal.~ The fact\n     that a very high temperature is necessary to decompose water\n     into hydrogen and oxygen is in accord with the fact that a\n     great deal of heat is evolved by the union of hydrogen and\n     oxygen; for it has been proved that the heat necessary to\n     decompose a compound into its elements (heat of decomposition)\n     is equal to the heat evolved in the formation of a compound\n     from its elements (heat of formation).",
  "~Water of crystallization.~ When a solid is dissolved in water and the\nresulting solution is allowed to evaporate, the solid separates out,\noften in the form of crystals. It has been found that the crystals of\nmany compounds, although perfectly dry, give up a definite amount of\nwater when heated, the substance at the same time losing its crystalline\nform. Such water is called _water of crystallization_. This varies in\namount with different compounds, but is perfectly definite for the same\ncompound. Thus, if a perfectly dry crystal of copper sulphate is\nstrongly heated in a tube, water is evolved and condenses on the sides\nof the tube, the crystal crumbling to a light powder. The weight of the\nwater evolved is always equal to exactly 36.07% of the weight of copper\nsulphate crystals heated. The water must therefore be in chemical\ncombination with the substance composing the crystal; for if simply\nmixed with it or adhering to it, not only would the substance appear\nmoist but the amount present would undoubtedly vary. The combination,\nhowever, must be a very weak one, since the water is often expelled by\neven a gentle heat. Indeed, in some cases the water is given up on\nsimple exposure to air. Such compounds are said to be _efflorescent_.\nThus a crystal of sodium sulphate (Glauber's salt) on exposure to air\ncrumbles to a fine powder, owing to the escape of its water of\ncrystallization. Other substances have just the opposite property: they\nabsorb moisture when exposed to the air. For example, if a bit of dry\ncalcium chloride is placed in moist air, in the course of a few hours it\nwill have absorbed sufficient moisture to dissolve it. Such substances\nare said to be _deliquescent_. A deliquescent body serves as a good\ndrying or _desiccating_ agent. We have already employed calcium chloride\nas an agent for absorbing the moisture from hydrogen. Many substances,\nas for example quartz, form crystals which contain no water of\ncrystallization.",
  "~Mechanically inclosed water.~ Water of crystallization must be\n     carefully distinguished from water which is mechanically\n     inclosed in a crystal and which can be removed by powdering the\n     crystal and drying. Thus, when crystals of common salt are\n     heated, the water inclosed in the crystal is changed into steam\n     and bursts the crystal with a crackling sound. Such crystals\n     are said to _decrepitate_. That this water is not combined is\n     proved by the fact that the amount present varies and that it\n     has all the properties of water.",
  "~Uses of water.~ The importance of water in its relation to life and\ncommerce is too well known to require comment. Its importance to the\nchemist has also been pointed out. It remains to call attention to the\nfact that it is used as a standard in many physical measurements. Thus\n0° and 100° on the centigrade scale are respectively the freezing and\nthe boiling points of water under normal pressure. The weight of 1 cc.\nof water at its point of greatest density is the unit of weight in the\nmetric system, namely, the gram. It is also taken as the unit for the\ndetermination of the density of liquids and solids as well as for the\nmeasurement of amounts of heat.",
  "HYDROGEN DIOXIDE",
  "~Composition.~ As has been shown, 1 part by weight of hydrogen combines\nwith 7.94 parts by weight of oxygen to form water. It is possible,\nhowever, to obtain a second compound of hydrogen and oxygen differing\nfrom water in composition in that 1 part by weight of hydrogen is\ncombined with 2 × 7.94, or 15.88 parts, of oxygen. This compound is\ncalled _hydrogen dioxide_ or _hydrogen peroxide_, the prefixes _di-_ and\n_per-_ signifying that it contains more oxygen than hydrogen oxide,\nwhich is the chemical name for water.",
  "~Preparation.~ Hydrogen dioxide cannot be prepared cheaply by the direct\nunion of hydrogen and oxygen, and indirect methods must therefore be\nused. It is commonly prepared by the action of a solution of sulphuric\nacid on barium dioxide. The change which takes place may be indicated as\nfollows:",
  "sulphuric acid +  barium dioxide =  barium sulphate + hydrogen dioxide\n--------------    --------------    ---------------   ----------------\n  hydrogen          barium           barium             hydrogen\n  sulphur           oxygen           sulphur            oxygen\n  oxygen                             oxygen",
  "In other words, the barium and hydrogen in the two compounds exchange\nplaces. By this method a dilute solution of the dioxide in water is\nobtained. It is possible to separate the dioxide from the water by\nfractional distillation. This is attended with great difficulties,\nhowever, since the pure dioxide is explosive. The distillation is\ncarried on under diminished pressure so as to lower the boiling points\nas much as possible; otherwise the high temperature would decompose the\ndioxide.",
  "~Properties.~ Pure hydrogen dioxide is a colorless sirupy liquid having a\ndensity of 1.49. Its most characteristic property is the ease with which\nit decomposes into water and oxygen. One part by weight of hydrogen is\ncapable of holding firmly only 7.94 parts of oxygen. The additional 7.94\nparts of oxygen present in hydrogen dioxide are therefore easily\nevolved, the compound breaking down into water and oxygen. This\ndecomposition is attended by the generation of considerable heat. In\ndilute solution hydrogen dioxide is fairly stable, although such a\nsolution should be kept in a dark, cool place, since both heat and light\naid in the decomposition of the dioxide.",
  "~Uses.~ Solutions of hydrogen dioxide are used largely as oxidizing\nagents. The solution sold by druggists contains 3% of the dioxide and is\nused in medicine as an antiseptic. Its use as an antiseptic depends upon\nits oxidizing properties.",

  "THE ATOMIC THEORY",
  "~Three fundamental laws of matter.~ Before we can gain any very definite\nidea in regard to the structure of matter, and the way in which\ndifferent kinds of substances act chemically upon each other, it is\nnecessary to have clearly in view three fundamental laws of matter.\nThese laws have been established by experiment, and any conception which\nmay be formed concerning matter must therefore be in harmony with them.\nThe laws are as follows:",
  "~Law of conservation of matter.~ This law has already been touched upon in\nthe introductory chapter, and needs no further discussion. It will be\nrecalled that it may be stated thus: _Matter can neither be created nor\ndestroyed, though it can be changed from one form into another._",
  "~Law of definite composition.~ In the earlier days of chemistry there was\nmuch discussion as to whether the composition of a given compound is\nalways precisely the same or whether it is subject to some variation.\nTwo Frenchmen, Berthollet and Proust, were the leaders in this\ndiscussion, and a great deal of most useful experimenting was done to\ndecide the question. Their experiments, as well as all succeeding ones,\nhave shown that the composition of a pure chemical compound is always\nexactly the same. Water obtained by melting pure ice, condensing steam,\nburning hydrogen in oxygen, has always 11.18% hydrogen and 88.82% oxygen\nin it. Red oxide of mercury, from whatever source it is obtained,\ncontains 92.6% mercury and 7.4% oxygen. This truth is known as _the law\nof definite composition_, and may be stated thus: _The composition of a\nchemical compound never varies._",
  "~Law of multiple proportion.~ It has already been noted, however, that\nhydrogen and oxygen combine in two different ratios to form water and\nhydrogen dioxide respectively. It will be observed that this fact does\nnot contradict the law of definite composition, for entirely different\nsubstances are formed. These compounds differ from each other in\ncomposition, but the composition of each one is always constant. This\nability of two elements to unite in more than one ratio is very\nfrequently observed. Carbon and oxygen combine in two different ratios;\nnitrogen and oxygen combine to form as many as five distinct compounds,\neach with its own precise composition.",
  "In the first decade of the last century John Dalton, an English\nschool-teacher and philosopher, endeavored to find some rule which holds\nbetween the ratios in which two given substances combine. His studies\nbrought to light a very simple relation, which the following examples\nwill make clear. In water the hydrogen and oxygen are combined in the\nratio of 1 part by weight of hydrogen to 7.94 parts by weight of oxygen.\nIn hydrogen dioxide the 1 part by weight of hydrogen is combined with\n15.88 parts by weight of oxygen. The ratio between the amounts of oxygen\nwhich combine with the same amount of hydrogen to form water and\nhydrogen dioxide respectively is therefore 7.94: 15.88, or 1: 2.",
  "[Illustration: JOHN DALTON (English) (1766-1844)",
  "Developed the atomic theory; made many studies on the properties and the\ncomposition of gases. His book entitled \"A New System of Chemical\nPhilosophy\" had a large influence on the development of chemistry]",
  "Similarly, the element iron combines with oxygen to form two oxides, one\nof which is black and the other red. By analysis it has been shown that\nthe former contains 1 part by weight of iron combined with 0.286 parts\nby weight of oxygen, while the latter contains 1 part by weight of iron\ncombined with 0.429 parts by weight of oxygen. Here again we find that\nthe amounts of oxygen which combine with the same fixed amount of iron\nto form the two compounds are in the ratio of small whole numbers, viz.,\n2:3.",
  "Many other examples of this simple relation might be given, since it has\nbeen found to hold true in all cases where more than one compound is,\nformed from the same elements. Dalton's law of multiple proportion\nstates these facts as follows: _When any two elements,_ A _and_ B,\n_combine to form more than one compound, the amounts of_ B _which unite\nwith any fixed amount of_ A _bear the ratio of small whole numbers to\neach other_.",
  "~Hypothesis necessary to explain the laws of matter.~ These three\ngeneralizations are called _laws_, because they express in concise\nlanguage truths which are found by careful experiment to hold good in\nall cases. They do not offer any explanation of the facts, but merely\nstate them. The human mind, however, does not rest content with the mere\nbare facts, but seeks ever to learn the explanation of the facts. A\nsuggestion which is offered to explain such a set of facts is called an\n_hypothesis_. The suggestion which Dalton offered to explain the three\nlaws of matter, called the _atomic hypothesis_, was prompted by his view\nof the constitution of matter, and it involves three distinct\nassumptions in regard to the nature of matter and chemical action.\nDalton could not prove these assumptions to be true, but he saw that if\nthey were true the laws of matter become very easy to understand.",
  "~Dalton's atomic hypothesis.~ The three assumptions which Dalton made in\nregard to the nature of matter, and which together constitute the atomic\nhypothesis, are these:",
  "1. All elements are made up of minute, independent particles which\nDalton designated as _atoms_.",
  "2. All atoms of the same element have equal masses; those of different\nelements have different masses; in any change to which an atom is\nsubjected its mass does not change.",
  "3. When two or more elements unite to form a compound, the action\nconsists in the union of a definite small number of atoms of each\nelement to form a small particle of the compound. The smallest particles\nof a given compound are therefore exactly alike in the number and kinds\nof atoms which they contain, and larger masses of the substances are\nsimply aggregations of these least particles.",
  "~Molecules and atoms.~ Dalton applied the name atom not only to the minute\nparticles of the elements but also to the least particles of compounds.\nLater Avogadro, an Italian scientist, pointed out the fact that the two\nare different, since the smallest particle of an element is a unit,\nwhile that of a compound must have at least two units in it. He\nsuggested the name _molecule_ for the least particle of a compound which\ncan exist, retaining the name _atom_ for the smallest particle of an\nelement. In accordance with this distinction, we may define the atom and\nthe molecule as follows: _An atom is the smallest particle of an element\nwhich can exist. A molecule is the smallest particle of a compound which\ncan exist._ It will be shown in a subsequent chapter that sometimes two\nor more atoms of the same element unite with each other to form\nmolecules of the element. While the term atom, therefore, is applicable\nonly to elements, the term molecule is applicable both to elements and\ncompounds.",
  "~The atomic hypothesis and the laws of matter.~ Supposing the atomic\nhypothesis to be true, let us now see if it is in harmony with the laws\nof matter.",
  "1. _The atomic hypothesis and the law of conservation of matter._ It is\nevident that if the atoms never change their masses in any change which\nthey undergo, the total quantity of matter can never change and the law\nof conservation of matter must follow.",
  "2. _The atomic hypothesis and the law of definite composition._\nAccording to the third supposition, when iron combines with sulphur the\nunion is between definite numbers of the two kinds of atoms. In the\nsimplest case one atom of the one element combines with one atom of the\nother. If the sulphur and the iron atoms never change their respective\nmasses when they unite to form a molecule of iron sulphide, all iron\nsulphide molecules will have equal amounts of iron in them and also of\nsulphur. Consequently any mass made up of iron sulphide molecules will\nhave the same fraction of iron by weight as do the individual iron\nsulphide molecules. Iron sulphide, from whatever source, will have the\nsame composition, which is in accordance with the law of definite\ncomposition.",
  "3. _The atomic hypothesis and the law of multiple proportion._ But this\nsimplest case may not always be the only one. Under other conditions one\natom of iron might combine with two of sulphur to form a molecule of a\nsecond compound. In such a case the one atom of iron would be in\ncombination with twice the mass of sulphur that is in the first\ncompound, since the sulphur atoms all have equal masses. What is true\nfor one molecule will be true for any number of them; consequently when\nsuch quantities of these two compounds are selected as are found to\ncontain the same amount of iron, the one will contain twice as much\nsulphur as the other.",
  "The combination between the atoms may of course take place in other\nsimple ratios. For example, two atoms of one element might combine with\nthree or with five of the other. In all such cases it is clear that the\nlaw of multiple proportion must hold true. For on selecting such numbers\nof the two kinds of molecules as have the same number of the one kind of\natoms, the numbers of the other kind of atoms will stand in some simple\nratio to each other, and their weights will therefore stand in the same\nsimple ratio.",
  "~Testing the hypothesis.~ Efforts have been made to find compounds which\ndo not conform to these laws, but all such attempts have resulted in\nfailure. If such compounds should be found, the laws would be no longer\ntrue, and the hypothesis of Dalton would cease to possess value. When an\nhypothesis has been tested in every way in which experiment can test it,\nand is still found to be in harmony with the facts in the case, it is\ntermed a _theory_. We now speak of the atomic theory rather than of the\natomic hypothesis.",
  "~Value of a theory.~ The value of a theory is twofold. It aids in the\nclear understanding of the laws of nature because it gives an\nintelligent idea as to why these laws should be in operation.",
  "A theory also leads to discoveries. It usually happens that in testing a\ntheory much valuable work is done, and many new facts are discovered.\nAlmost any theory in explaining given laws will involve a number of\nconsequences apart from the laws it seeks to explain. Experiment will\nsoon show whether these facts are as the theory predicts they will be.\nThus Dalton's atomic theory predicted many properties of gases which\nexperiment has since verified.",
  "~Atomic weights.~ It would be of great advantage in the study of chemistry\nif we could determine the weights of the different kinds of atoms. It is\nevident that this cannot be done directly. They are so small that they\ncannot be seen even with a most powerful microscope. It is calculated\nthat it would take 200,000,000 hydrogen atoms placed side by side to\nmake a row one centimeter long. No balance can weigh such minute\nobjects. It is possible, however, to determine their relative\nweights,--that is, how much heavier one is than another. _These relative\nweights of the atoms are spoken of as the atomic weights of the\nelements._",
  "If elements were able to combine in only one way,--one atom of one with\none atom of another,--the problem of determining the atomic weights\nwould be very simple. We should merely have to take some one convenient\nelement as a standard, and find by experiment how much of each other\nelement would combine with a fixed weight of it. The ratios thus found\nwould be the same ratios as those between the atoms of the elements, and\nthus we should have their relative atomic weights. The law of multiple\nproportion calls attention to the fact that the atoms combine in other\nratios than 1: 1, and there is no direct way of telling which one, if\nany, of the several compounds in a given case is the one consisting of a\nsingle atom of each element.",
  "If some way were to be found of telling how much heavier the entire\nmolecule of a compound is than the atom chosen as a standard,--that is,\nof determining the molecular weights of compounds,--the problem could be\nsolved, though its solution would not be an entirely simple matter.\nThere are ways of determining the molecular weights of compounds, and\nthere are other experiments which throw light directly upon the relative\nweights of the atoms. These methods cannot be described until the facts\nupon which they rest have been studied. It will be sufficient for the\npresent to assume that these methods are trustworthy.",
  "~Standard for atomic weights.~ Since the atomic weights are merely\nrelative to some one element chosen as a standard, it is evident that\nany one of the elements may serve as this standard and that any\nconvenient value may be assigned to its atom. At one time oxygen was\ntaken as this standard, with the value 100, and the atomic weights of\nthe other elements were expressed in terms of this standard. It would\nseem more rational to take the element of smallest atomic weight as the\nstandard and give it unit value; accordingly hydrogen was taken as the\nstandard with an atomic weight of 1. Very recently, however, this unit\nhas been replaced by oxygen, with an atomic weight of 16.",
  "~Why oxygen is chosen as the standard for atomic weights.~ In the\ndetermination of the atomic weight of an element it is necessary to find\nthe weight of the element which combines with a definite weight of\nanother element, preferably the element chosen as the standard. Since\noxygen combines with the elements far more readily than does hydrogen to\nform definite compounds, it is far better adapted for the standard\nelement, and has accordingly replaced hydrogen as the standard. Any\ndefinite value might be given to the weight of the oxygen atom. In\nassigning a value to it, however, it is convenient to choose a whole\nnumber, and as small a number as possible without making the atomic\nweight of any other element less than unity. For these reasons the\nnumber 16 has been chosen as the atomic weight of oxygen. This makes\nthe atomic weight of hydrogen equal to 1.008, so that there is but\nlittle difference between taking oxygen as 16 and hydrogen as 1 for the\nunit.",

  "CHEMICAL EQUATIONS AND CALCULATIONS",
  "~Formulas.~ Since the molecule of any chemical compound consists of a\ndefinite number of atoms, and this number never changes without\ndestroying the identity of the compound, it is very convenient to\nrepresent the composition of a compound by indicating the composition of\nits molecules. This can be done very easily by using the symbols of the\natoms to indicate the number and the kind of the atoms which constitute\nthe molecule. HgO will in this way represent mercuric oxide, a molecule\nof which has been found to contain 1 atom each of mercury and oxygen.\nH_{2}O will represent water, the molecules of which consist of 1 atom of\noxygen and 2 of hydrogen, the subscript figure indicating the number of\nthe atoms of the element whose symbol precedes it. H_{2}SO_{4} will\nstand for sulphuric acid, the molecules of which contain 2 atoms of\nhydrogen, 1 of sulphur, and 4 of oxygen. The combination of symbols\nwhich represents the molecule of a substance is called its _formula_.",
  "~Equations.~ When a given substance undergoes a chemical change it is\npossible to represent this change by the use of such symbols and\nformulas. In a former chapter it was shown that mercuric oxide\ndecomposes when heated to form mercury and oxygen. This may be expressed\nvery briefly in the form of the equation",
  "(1) HgO = Hg + O.",
  "When water is electrolyzed two new substances, hydrogen and oxygen, are\nformed from it. This statement in the form of an equation is",
  "(2) H_{2}O = 2H + O.",
  "The coefficient before the symbol for hydrogen indicates that a single\nmolecule of water yields two atoms of hydrogen on decomposition.",
  "In like manner the combination of sulphur with iron is expressed by the\nequation",
  "(3) Fe + S = FeS.",
  "The decomposition of potassium chlorate by heat takes place as\nrepresented by the equation",
  "(4) KClO_{3} = KCl + 3O.",
  "~Reading of equations.~ Since equations are simply a kind of shorthand way\nof indicating chemical changes which occur under certain conditions, in\nreading an equation the full statement for which it stands should be\ngiven. Equation (1) should be read, \"Mercuric oxide when heated gives\nmercury and oxygen\"; equation (2) is equivalent to the statement, \"When\nelectrolyzed, water produces hydrogen and oxygen\"; equation (3), \"When\nheated together iron and sulphur unite to form iron sulphide\"; equation\n(4), \"Potassium chlorate when heated yields potassium chloride and\noxygen.\"",
  "~Knowledge required for writing equations.~ In order to write such\nequations correctly, a considerable amount of exact knowledge is\nrequired. Thus, in equation (1) the fact that red oxide of mercury has\nthe composition represented by the formula HgO, that it is decomposed by\nheat, that in this decomposition mercury and oxygen are formed and no\nother products,--all these facts must be ascertained by exact experiment\nbefore the equation can be written. An equation expressing these facts\nwill then have much value.",
  "Having obtained an equation describing the conduct of mercuric oxide on\nbeing heated, it will not do to assume that other oxides will behave in\nlike manner. Iron oxide (FeO) resembles mercuric oxide in many respects,\nbut it undergoes no change at all when heated. Manganese dioxide, the\nblack substance used in the preparation of oxygen, has the formula\nMnO_{2}. When this substance is heated oxygen is set free, but the metal\nmanganese is not liberated; instead, a different oxide of manganese\ncontaining less oxygen is produced. The equation representing the\nreaction is",
  "3MnO_{2} = Mn_{3}O_{4} + 2O.",
  "~Classes of reactions.~ When a chemical change takes place in a substance\nthe substance is said to undergo a reaction. Although a great many\ndifferent reactions will be met in the study of chemistry, they may all\nbe grouped under the following heads.",
  "1. _Addition._ This is the simplest kind of chemical action. It consists\nin the union of two or more substances to produce a new substance. The\ncombination of iron with sulphur is an example:",
  "Fe + S = FeS.",
  "2. _Decomposition._ This is the reverse of addition, the substance\nundergoing reaction being parted into its constituents. The\ndecomposition of mercuric oxide is an example: HgO = Hg + O.",
  "3. _Substitution._ It is sometimes possible for an element in the free\nstate to act upon a compound in such a way that it takes the place of\none of the elements of the compound, liberating it in turn. In the study\nof the element hydrogen it was pointed out that hydrogen is most\nconveniently prepared by the action of sulphuric or hydrochloric acid\nupon zinc. When sulphuric acid is used a substance called zinc sulphate,\nhaving the composition represented by the formula ZnSO_{4}, is formed\ntogether with hydrogen. The equation is",
  "Zn + H_{2}SO_{4} = ZnSO_{4} + 2H.",
  "When hydrochloric acid is used zinc chloride and hydrogen are the\nproducts of reaction:",
  "Zn + 2HCl = ZnCl_{2} + 2H.",
  "When iron is used in place of zinc the equation is",
  "Fe + H_{2}SO_{4} = FeSO_{4} + 2H.",
  "These reactions are quite similar, as is apparent from an examination of\nthe equations. In each case 1 atom of the metal replaces 2 atoms of\nhydrogen in the acid, and the hydrogen escapes as a gas. When an element\nin the free state, such as the zinc in the equations just given, takes\nthe place of some one element in a compound, setting it free from\nchemical combination, the act is called _substitution_.",
  "Other reactions illustrating substitution are the action of sodium on\nwater,",
  "Na + H_{2}O = NaOH + H;",
  "and the action of heated iron upon water,",
  "3Fe + 4H_{2}O = Fe_{3}O_{4} + 8H.",
  "4. _Double decomposition._ When barium dioxide (BaO_{2}) is treated with\nsulphuric acid two compounds are formed, namely, hydrogen dioxide\n(H_{2}O_{2}) and barium sulphate (BaSO_{4}). The equation is",
  "BaO_{2} + H_{2}SO_{4} = BaSO_{4} + H_{2}O_{2}.",
  "In this reaction it will be seen that the two elements barium and\nhydrogen simply exchange places. Such a reaction is called a _double\ndecomposition_. We shall meet with many examples of this kind of\nchemical reactions.",
  "~Chemical equations are quantitative.~ The use of symbols and formulas in\nexpressing chemical changes has another great advantage. Thus, according\nto the equation",
  "H_{2}O = 2H + O,",
  "1 molecule of water is decomposed into 2 atoms of hydrogen and 1 atom of\noxygen. But, as we have seen, the relative weights of the atoms are\nknown, that of hydrogen being 1.008, while that of oxygen is 16. The\nmolecule of water, being composed of 2 atoms of hydrogen and 1 atom of\noxygen, must therefore weigh relatively 2.016 + 16, or 18.016. The\namount of hydrogen in this molecule must be 2.016/18.016, or 11.18% of\nthe whole, while the amount of oxygen must be 16/18.018, or 88.82% of\nthe whole. Now, since any definite quantity of water is simply the sum\nof a great many molecules of water, it is plain that the fractions\nrepresenting the relative amounts of hydrogen and oxygen present in a\nmolecule must likewise express the relative amounts of hydrogen and\noxygen present in any quantity of water. Thus, for example, in 20 g. of\nwater there are 2.016/18.016 × 20, or 2.238 g. of hydrogen, and\n16/18.016 × 20, or 17.762 g. of oxygen. These results in reference to\nthe composition of water of course agree exactly with the facts obtained\nby the experiments described in the chapter on water, for it is because\nof those experiments that the values 1.008 and 16 are given to hydrogen\nand oxygen respectively.",
  "It is often easier to make calculations of this kind in the form of a\nproportion rather than by fractions. Since the molecule of water and\nthe two atoms of hydrogen which it contains have the ratio by weight of\n18.016: 2.016, any mass of water has the same ratio between its total\nweight and the weight of the hydrogen in it. Hence, to find the number\nof grams (x) of hydrogen in 20 g. of water, we have the proportion",
  "18.016 : 2.016 :: 20 g. : x (grams of hydrogen).",
  "Solving for x, we get 2.238 for the number of grams of hydrogen.\nSimilarly, to find the amount (x) of oxygen present in the 20 g. of\nwater, we have the proportion",
  "18.016 : 16 :: 20 : x",
  "from which we find that x = 17.762 g.",
  "Again, suppose we wish to find what weight of oxygen can be obtained\nfrom 15 g. of mercuric oxide. The equation representing the\ndecomposition of mercuric oxide is",
  "HgO = Hg + O.",
  "The relative weights of the mercury and oxygen atoms are respectively\n200 and 16. The relative weight of the mercuric oxide molecule must\ntherefore be the sum of these, or 216. The molecule of mercuric oxide\nand the atom of oxygen which it contains have the ratio 216: 16. This\nsame ratio must therefore hold between the weight of any given quantity\nof mercuric oxide and that of the oxygen which it contains. Hence, to\nfind the weight of oxygen in 15 g. of mercuric oxide, we have the\nproportion",
  "216 : 16 :: 15 : x (grams of oxygen).",
  "On the other hand, suppose we wish to prepare, say, 20 g. of oxygen. The\nproblem is to find out what weight of mercuric oxide will yield 20 g. of\noxygen. The following proportion evidently holds",
  "216 : 16 :: x (grams of mercuric oxide) : 20;",
  "from which we get x = 270.",
  "In the preparation of hydrogen by the action of sulphuric acid upon\nzinc, according to the equation,",
  "Zn + H_{2}SO_{4} = ZnSO_{4} + 2 H,",
  "suppose that 50 g. of zinc are available; let it be required to\ncalculate the weight of hydrogen which can be obtained. It will be seen\nthat 1 atom of zinc will liberate 2 atoms of hydrogen. The ratio by\nweight of a zinc to an hydrogen atom is 65.4: 1.008; of 1 zinc atom to 2\nhydrogen atoms, 65.4: 2.016. Zinc and hydrogen will be related in this\nreaction in this same ratio, however many atoms of zinc are concerned.\nConsequently in the proportion",
  "65.4 : 2.016 :: 50 : x,",
  "x will be the weight of hydrogen set free by 50 g. of zinc. The weight\nof zinc sulphate produced at the same time can be found from the\nproportion",
  "65.4 : 161.46 :: 50 : x;",
  "where 161.46 is the molecular weight of the zinc sulphate, and x the\nweight of zinc sulphate formed. In like manner, the weight of sulphuric\nacid used up can be calculated from the proportion",
  "65.4 : 98.076 :: 50 : x.",
  "These simple calculations are possible because the symbols and formulas\nin the equations represent the relative weights of the substances\nconcerned in a chemical reaction. When once the relative weights of the\natoms have been determined, and it has been agreed to allow the symbols\nto stand for these relative weights, an equation or formula making use\nof the symbols becomes a statement of a definite numerical fact, and\ncalculations can be based on it.",
  "~Chemical equations not algebraic.~ Although chemical equations are\nquantitative, it must be clearly understood that they are not algebraic.\nA glance at the equations",
  "7 + 4 = 11, 8 + 5 = 9 + 4",
  "will show at once that they are true. The equations",
  "HgO = Hg + O, FeO = Fe + O",
  "are equally true in an algebraic sense, but experiment shows that only\nthe first is true chemically, for iron oxide (FeO) cannot be directly\ndecomposed into iron and oxygen. Only such equations as have been found\nby careful experiment to express a real chemical transformation, true\nboth for the kinds of substances as well as for the weights, have any\nvalue.",
  "_Chemical formulas and equations, therefore, are a concise way of\nrepresenting qualitatively and quantitatively facts which have been\nfound by experiment to be true in reference to the composition of\nsubstances and the changes which they undergo._",
  "~Formulas representing water of crystallization.~ An examination of\nsubstances containing water of crystallization has shown that in every\ncase the water is present in such proportion by weight as can readily be\nrepresented by a formula. For example, copper sulphate (CuSO_{4}) and\nwater combine in the ratio of 1 molecule of the sulphate to 5 of water;\ncalcium sulphate (CaSO_{4}) and water combine in the ratio 1: 2 to form\ngypsum. These facts are expressed by writing the formulas for the two\nsubstances with a period between them. Thus the formula for crystallized\ncopper sulphate is CuSO_{4}·5H_{2}O; that of gypsum is CaSO_{4}·2H_{2}O.",
  "~Heat of reaction.~ Attention has frequently been directed to the fact\nthat chemical changes are usually accompanied by heat changes. In\ngeneral it has been found that in every chemical action heat is either\nabsorbed or given off. By adopting a suitable unit for the measurement\nof heat, the heat change during a chemical reaction can be expressed in\nthe equation for the reaction.",
  "Heat cannot be measured by the use of a thermometer alone, since the\nthermometer measures the intensity of heat, not its quantity. The\neasiest way to measure a quantity of heat is to note how warm it will\nmake a definite amount of a given substance chosen as a standard. Water\nhas been chosen as the standard, and the unit of heat is called a\n_calorie. A calorie is defined as the amount of heat required to raise\nthe temperature of one gram of water one degree._",
  "By means of this unit it is easy to indicate the heat changes in a given\nchemical reaction. The equation",
  "2H + O = H_{2}O + 68,300 cal.",
  "means that when 2.016 g. of hydrogen combine with 16 g. of oxygen,\n18.016 g. of water are formed and 68,300 cal. are set free.",
  "C + 2S = CS_{2} - 19,000 cal.",
  "means that an expenditure of 19,000 cal. is required to cause 12 g. of\ncarbon to unite with 64.12 g. of sulphur to form 76.12 g. of carbon\ndisulphide. In these equations it will be noted that the symbols stand\nfor as many grams of the substance as there are units in the weights of\nthe atoms represented by the symbols. This is always understood to be\nthe case in equations where the heat of reaction is given.",
  "~Conditions of a chemical action are not indicated by equations.~\nEquations do not tell the conditions under which a reaction will take\nplace. The equation",
  "HgO = Hg + O",
  "does not tell us that it is necessary to keep the mercuric oxide at a\nhigh temperature in order that the decomposition may go on. The equation",
  "Zn + 2HCl = ZnCl_{2} + 2H",
  "in no way indicates the fact that the hydrochloric acid must be\ndissolved in water before it will act upon the zinc. From the equation",
  "H + Cl = HCl",
  "it would not be suspected that the two gases hydrogen and chlorine will\nunite instantly in the sunlight, but will stand mixed in the dark a long\ntime without change. It will therefore be necessary to pay much\nattention to the details of the conditions under which a given reaction\noccurs, as well as to the expression of the reaction in the form of an\nequation.",

  "NITROGEN AND THE RARE ELEMENTS: ARGON, HELIUM, NEON, KRYPTON, XENON",
  "~Historical.~ Nitrogen was discovered by the English chemist Rutherford in\n1772. A little later Scheele showed it to be a constituent of air, and\nLavoisier gave it the name _azote_, signifying that it would not support\nlife. The name _nitrogen_ was afterwards given it because of its\npresence in saltpeter or niter. The term azote and symbol Az are still\nretained by the French chemists.",
  "~Occurrence.~ Air is composed principally of oxygen and nitrogen in the\nfree state, about 78 parts by volume out of every 100 parts being\nnitrogen. Nitrogen also occurs in nature in the form of potassium\nnitrate (KNO_{3})--commonly called saltpeter or niter--as well as in\nsodium nitrate (NaNO_{3}). Nitrogen is also an essential constituent of\nall living organisms; for example, the human body contains about 2.4% of\nnitrogen.",
  "~Preparation from air.~ Nitrogen can be prepared from air by the action of\nsome substance which will combine with the oxygen, leaving the nitrogen\nfree. Such a substance must be chosen, however, as will combine with the\noxygen to form a product which is not a gas, and which can be readily\nseparated from the nitrogen. The substances most commonly used for this\npurpose are phosphorus and copper.",
  "1. _By the action of phosphorus._ The method used for the preparation of\nnitrogen by the action of phosphorus is as follows:",
  "The phosphorus is placed in a little porcelain dish, supported on a cork\nand floated on water (Fig. 26). It is then ignited by contact with a hot\nwire, and immediately a bell jar or bottle is brought over it so as to\nconfine a portion of the air. The phosphorus combines with the oxygen to\nform an oxide of phosphorus, known as phosphorus pentoxide. This is a\nwhite solid which floats about in the bell jar, but in a short time it\nis all absorbed by the water, leaving the nitrogen. The withdrawal of\nthe oxygen is indicated by the rising of the water in the bell jar.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 26]",
  "2. _By the action of copper._ The oxygen present in the air may also be\nremoved by passing air slowly through a heated tube containing copper.\nThe copper combines with the oxygen to form copper oxide, which is a\nsolid. The nitrogen passes on and may be collected over water.",
  "~Nitrogen obtained from air is not pure.~ Inasmuch as air, in\n     addition to oxygen and nitrogen, contains small amounts of\n     other gases, and since the phosphorus as well as the copper\n     removes only the oxygen, it is evident that the nitrogen\n     obtained by these methods is never quite pure. About 1% of the\n     product is composed of other gases, from which it is very\n     difficult to separate the nitrogen. The impure nitrogen so\n     obtained may, however, be used for a study of most of the\n     properties of nitrogen, since these are not materially affected\n     by the presence of the other gases.",
  "~Preparation from compounds of nitrogen.~ Pure nitrogen may be obtained\nfrom certain compounds of the element. Thus, if heat is applied to the\ncompound ammonium nitrite (NH_{4}NO_{2}), the change represented in the\nfollowing equation takes place:",
  "NH_{4}NO_{2} = 2H_{2}O + 2N.",
  "~Physical properties.~ Nitrogen is similar to oxygen and hydrogen in that\nit is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas. One liter of nitrogen\nweighs 1.2501 g. It is almost insoluble in water. It can be obtained in\nthe form of a colorless liquid having a boiling point of -195° at\nordinary pressure. At -214° it solidifies.",
  "~Chemical properties.~ Nitrogen is characterized by its inertness. It is\nneither combustible nor a supporter of combustion. At ordinary\ntemperatures it will not combine directly with any of the elements\nexcept under rare conditions. At higher temperatures it combines with\nmagnesium, lithium, titanium, and a number of other elements. The\ncompounds formed are called _nitrides_, just as compounds of an element\nwith oxygen are called _oxides_. When it is mixed with oxygen and\nsubjected to the action of electric sparks, the two gases slowly combine\nforming oxides of nitrogen. A mixture of nitrogen and hydrogen when\ntreated similarly forms ammonia, a gaseous compound of nitrogen and\nhydrogen. Since we are constantly inhaling nitrogen, it is evident that\nit is not poisonous. Nevertheless life would be impossible in an\natmosphere of pure nitrogen on account of the exclusion of the necessary\noxygen.",
  "~Argon, helium, neon, krypton, xenon.~ These are all rare\n     elements occurring in the air in very small quantities. Argon,\n     discovered in 1894, was the first one obtained. Lord Rayleigh,\n     an English scientist, while engaged in determining the exact\n     weights of various gases, observed that the nitrogen obtained\n     from the air is slightly heavier than pure nitrogen obtained\n     from its compounds. After repeating his experiments many times,\n     always with the same results, Rayleigh finally concluded that\n     the nitrogen which he had obtained from the air was not pure,\n     but was mixed with a small amount of some unknown gas, the\n     density of which is greater than that of nitrogen. Acting on\n     this assumption, Rayleigh, together with the English chemist\n     Ramsay, attempted to separate the nitrogen from the unknown\n     gas. Knowing that nitrogen would combine with magnesium, they\n     passed the nitrogen obtained from the air and freed from all\n     known substances through tubes containing magnesium heated to\n     the necessary temperature. After repeating this operation, they\n     finally succeeded in obtaining from the atmospheric nitrogen a\n     small volume of gas which would not combine with magnesium and\n     hence could not be nitrogen. This proved to be a new element,\n     to which they gave the name _argon_. As predicted, this new\n     element was found to be heavier than nitrogen, its density as\n     compared with hydrogen as a standard being approximately 20,\n     that of nitrogen being only 14. About 1% of the atmospheric\n     nitrogen proved to be argon. The new element is characterized\n     by having no affinity for other elements. Even under the most\n     favorable conditions it has not been made to combine with any\n     other element. On this account it was given the name argon,\n     signifying lazy or idle. Like nitrogen, it is colorless,\n     odorless, and tasteless. It has been liquefied and solidified.\n     Its boiling point is -187°.",
  "Helium was first found in the gases expelled from certain\n     minerals by heating. Through the agency of the spectroscope it\n     had been known to exist in the sun long before its presence on\n     the earth had been demonstrated,--a fact suggested by the name\n     helium, signifying the sun. Its existence in traces in the\n     atmosphere has also been proven. It was first liquefied by\n     Onnes in July, 1908. Its boiling point, namely -269°, is the\n     lowest temperature yet reached.",
  "The remaining elements of this group--neon, krypton, and\n     xenon--have been obtained from liquid air. When liquid air is\n     allowed to boil, the constituents which are the most difficult\n     to liquefy, and which therefore have the lowest boiling points,\n     vaporize first, followed by the others in the order of their\n     boiling points. It is possible in this way to make at least a\n     partial separation of the air into its constituents, and Ramsay\n     thus succeeded in obtaining from liquid air not only the known\n     constituents, including argon and helium, but also the new\n     elements, neon, krypton, and xenon. These elements, as well as\n     helium, all proved to be similar to argon in that they are\n     without chemical activity, apparently forming no compounds\n     whatever. The percentages present in the air are very small.\n     The names, neon, krypton, xenon, signify respectively, new,\n     hidden, stranger.",

  "THE ATMOSPHERE",
  "~Atmosphere and air.~ The term _atmosphere_ is applied to the gaseous\nenvelope surrounding the earth. The term _air_ is generally applied to a\nlimited portion of this envelope, although the two words are often used\ninterchangeably. Many references have already been made to the\ncomposition and properties of the atmosphere. These statements must now\nbe collected and discussed somewhat more in detail.",
  "~Air formerly regarded as an element.~ Like water, air was at first\nregarded as elementary in character. Near the close of the eighteenth\ncentury Scheele, Priestley, and Lavoisier showed by their experiments\nthat it is a mixture of at least two gases,--those which we now call\noxygen and nitrogen. By burning substances in an inclosed volume of air\nand noting the contraction in volume due to the removal of the oxygen,\nthey were able to determine with some accuracy the relative volumes of\noxygen and nitrogen present in the air.",
  "~The constituents of the atmosphere.~ The constituents of the atmosphere\nmay be divided into two general groups: those which are essential to\nlife and those which are not essential.",
  "1. _Constituents essential to life._ In addition to oxygen and nitrogen\nat least two other substances, namely, carbon dioxide and water vapor,\nmust be present in the atmosphere in order that life may exist. The\nformer of these is a gaseous compound of carbon and oxygen having the\nformula CO_{2}. Its properties will be discussed in detail in the\nchapter on the compounds of carbon. Its presence in the air may be shown\nby causing the air to bubble through a solution of calcium hydroxide\n(Ca(OH)_{2}), commonly called lime water. The carbon dioxide combines\nwith the calcium hydroxide in accordance with the following equation:",
  "Ca(OH)_{2} + CO_{2} = CaCO_{3} + H_{2}O.",
  "The resulting calcium carbonate (CaCO_{3}) is insoluble in water and\nseparates in the form of a white powder, which causes the solution to\nappear milky.",
  "The presence of water vapor is readily shown by its condensation on cold\nobjects as well as by the fact that a bit of calcium chloride when\nexposed to the air becomes moist, and may even dissolve in the water\nabsorbed from the air.",
  "2. _Constituents not essential to life._ In addition to the essential\nconstituents, the air contains small percentages of various other gases,\nthe presence of which so far as is known is not essential to life. This\nlist includes the rare elements, argon, helium, neon, krypton, and\nxenon; also hydrogen, ammonia, hydrogen dioxide, and probably ozone.\nCertain minute forms of life (germs) are also present, the decay of\norganic matter being due to their presence.",
  "~Function of each of the essential constituents.~ (1) The oxygen\n     directly supports life through respiration. (2) The nitrogen,\n     on account of its inactivity, serves to dilute the oxygen, and\n     while contrary to the older views, it is possible that life\n     might continue to exist in the absence of the atmospheric\n     nitrogen, yet the conditions of life would be entirely changed.\n     Moreover, nitrogen is an essential constituent of all animal\n     and plant life. It was formerly supposed that neither animals\n     nor plants could assimilate the free nitrogen, but it has been\n     shown recently that the plants of at least one natural order,\n     the Leguminosæ, to which belong the beans, peas, and clover,\n     have the power of directly assimilating the free nitrogen from\n     the atmosphere. This is accomplished through the agency of\n     groups of bacteria, which form colonies in little tubercles on\n     the roots of the plants. These bacteria probably assist in the\n     absorption of nitrogen by changing the free nitrogen into\n     compounds which can be assimilated by the plant. Fig. 27 shows\n     the tubercles on the roots of a variety of bean. (3) The\n     presence of water vapor in the air is necessary to prevent\n     excessive evaporation from both plants and animals. (4) Carbon\n     dioxide is an essential plant food.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 27]",
  "~The quantitative analysis of air.~ A number of different methods have\nbeen devised for the determination of the percentages of the\nconstituents present in the atmosphere. Among these are the following.",
  "1. _Determination of oxygen._ (1) The oxygen is withdrawn from a\nmeasured volume of air inclosed in a tube, by means of phosphorus.",
  "To make the determination, a graduated tube is filled with\n     water and inverted in a vessel of water. Air is introduced into\n     the tube until it is partially filled with the gas. The volume\n     of the inclosed air is carefully noted and reduced to standard\n     conditions. A small piece of phosphorus is attached to a wire\n     and brought within the tube as shown in Fig. 28. After a few\n     hours the oxygen in the inclosed air will have combined with\n     the phosphorus, the water rising to take its place. The\n     phosphorus is removed and the volume is again noted and reduced\n     to standard conditions. The contraction in the volume of the\n     air is equal to the volume of oxygen absorbed.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 28]",
  "(2) The oxygen may also be estimated by passing a measured volume of air\nthrough a tube containing copper heated to a high temperature. The\noxygen in the air combines with the copper to form copper oxide (CuO).\nHence the increase in the weight of the copper equals the weight of the\noxygen in the volume of air taken.",
  "(3) A more accurate method is the following. A eudiometer tube is filled\nwith mercury and inverted in a vessel of the same liquid. A convenient\namount of air is then introduced into the tube and its volume accurately\nnoted. There is then introduced more than sufficient hydrogen to combine\nwith the oxygen present in the inclosed air, and the volume is again\naccurately noted. The mixture is then exploded by an electric spark, and\nthe volume is once more taken. By subtracting this volume from the total\nvolume of the air and hydrogen there is obtained the contraction in\nvolume due to the union of the oxygen and hydrogen. The volume occupied\nby the water formed by the union of the two gases is so small that it\nmay be disregarded in the calculation. Since oxygen and hydrogen combine\nin the ratio 1: 2 by volume, it is evident that the contraction in\nvolume due to the combination is equal to the volume occupied by the\noxygen in the air contained in the tube, plus twice this volume of\nhydrogen. In other words, one third of the total contraction is equal to\nthe volume occupied by the oxygen in the inclosed air. The following\nexample will make this clear:",
  "Volume of air in tube                                        50.0 cc.\nVolume after introducing hydrogen                            80.0\nVolume after combination of oxygen and hydrogen              48.5\nContraction in volume due to combination (80 cc.-48.5 cc.)   31.5\nVolume of oxygen in 50 cc. of air (1/3 of 31.5)              10.5",
  "All these methods agree in showing that 100 volumes of dry air contain\napproximately 21 volumes of oxygen.",
  "2. _Determination of nitrogen._ If the gas left after the removal of\noxygen from a portion of air is passed over heated magnesium, the\nnitrogen is withdrawn, argon and the other rare elements being left. It\nmay thus be shown that of the 79 volumes of gas left after the removal\nof the oxygen from 100 volumes of air, approximately 78 are nitrogen and\n0.93 argon. The other elements are present in such small quantities that\nthey may be neglected.",
  "3. _Determination of carbon dioxide._ The percentage of carbon dioxide\nin any given volume of air may be determined by passing the air over\ncalcium hydroxide or some other compound which will combine with the\ncarbon dioxide. The increase in the weight of the hydroxide equals the\nweight of the carbon dioxide absorbed. The amount present in the open\nnormal air is from 3 to 4 parts by volume in 10,000 volumes of air, or\nabout 0.04%.",
  "4. _Determination of water vapor._ The water vapor present in a given\nvolume of air may be determined by passing the air over calcium chloride\n(or some other compound which has a strong affinity for water), and\nnoting the increase in the weight of the chloride. The amount present\nvaries not only with the locality, but there is a wide variation from\nday to day in the same locality because of the winds and changes in\ntemperature.",
  "~Processes affecting the composition of the air.~ The most important of\nthese processes are the following.",
  "1. _Respiration._ In the process of respiration some of the oxygen in\nthe inhaled air is absorbed by the blood and carried to all parts of the\nbody, where it combines with the carbon of the worn-out tissues. The\nproducts of oxidation are carried back to the lungs and exhaled in the\nform of carbon dioxide. The amount exhaled by an adult averages about 20\nl. per hour. Hence in a poorly ventilated room occupied by a number of\npeople the amount of carbon dioxide rapidly increases. While this gas is\nnot poisonous unless present in large amounts, nevertheless air\ncontaining more than 15 parts in 10,000 is not fit for respiration.",
  "2. _Combustion._ All of the ordinary forms of fuel contain large\npercentages of carbon. On burning, this carbon combines with oxygen in\nthe air, forming carbon dioxide. Combustion and respiration, therefore,\ntend to diminish the amount of oxygen in the air and to increase the\namount of carbon dioxide.",
  "3. _Action of plants._ Plants have the power, when in the sunlight, of\nabsorbing carbon dioxide from the air, retaining the carbon and\nreturning at least a portion of the oxygen to the air. It will be\nobserved that these changes are just the opposite of those brought about\nby the processes of respiration and combustion.",
  "~Poisonous effect of exhaled air.~ The differences in the\n     percentages of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and moisture present in\n     inhaled air and exhaled air are shown in the following\n     analyses.",
  "INHALED AIR     EXHALED AIR\n       Oxygen            21.00%          16.00%\n       Carbon dioxide     0.04            4.38\n       Moisture         variable        saturated",
  "The foul odor of respired air is due to the presence of a\n     certain amount of organic matter. It is possible that this\n     organic matter rather than the carbon dioxide is responsible\n     for the injurious effects which follow the respiration of\n     impure air. The extent of such organic impurities present may\n     be judged, however, by the amount of carbon dioxide present,\n     since the two are exhaled together.",
  "~The cycle of carbon in nature.~ Under the influence of sunlight,\n     the carbon dioxide absorbed from the air by plants reacts with\n     water and small amounts of other substances absorbed from the\n     soil to form complex compounds of carbon which constitute the\n     essential part of the plant tissue. This reaction is attended\n     by the evolution of oxygen, which is restored to the air. The\n     compounds resulting from these changes are much richer in their\n     energy content than are the substances from which they are\n     formed; hence a certain amount of energy must have been\n     absorbed in their formation. The source of this energy is the\n     sun's rays.",
  "If the plant is burned, the changes which took place in the\n     formation of the compounds present are largely reversed. The\n     carbon and hydrogen present combine with oxygen taken from the\n     air to form carbon dioxide and water, while the energy absorbed\n     from the sun's rays is liberated in the form of energy of heat.\n     If, on the other hand, the plant is used as food, the compounds\n     present are used in building up the tissues of the body. When\n     this tissue breaks down, the changes which it undergoes are\n     very similar to those which take place when the plant is\n     burned. The carbon and hydrogen combine with the inhaled oxygen\n     to form carbon dioxide and water, which are exhaled. The energy\n     possessed by the complex substances is liberated partly in the\n     form of energy of heat, which maintains the heat of the body,\n     and partly in the various forms of muscular energy. The carbon\n     originally absorbed from the air by the plant in the form of\n     carbon dioxide is thus restored to the air and is ready to\n     repeat the cycle of changes.",
  "~The composition of the air is constant.~ Notwithstanding the changes\nconstantly taking place which tend to alter the composition of the air,\nthe results of a great many analyses of air collected in the open fields\nshow that the percentages of oxygen and nitrogen as well as of carbon\ndioxide are very nearly constant. Indeed, so constant are the\npercentages of oxygen and nitrogen that the question has arisen, whether\nthese two elements are not combined in the air, forming a definite\nchemical compound. That the two are not combined but are simply mixed\ntogether can be shown in a number of ways, among which are the\nfollowing.",
  "1. When air dissolves in water it has been found that the ratio of\noxygen to nitrogen in the dissolved air is no longer 21: 78, but more\nnearly 35: 65. If it were a chemical compound, the ratio of oxygen to\nnitrogen would not be changed by solution in water.",
  "2. A chemical compound in the form of a liquid has a definite boiling\npoint. Water, for example, boils at 100°. Moreover the steam which is\nthus formed has the same composition as the water. The boiling point of\nliquid air, on the other hand, gradually rises as the liquid boils, the\nnitrogen escaping first followed by the oxygen. If the two were\ncombined, they would pass off together in the ratio in which they are\nfound in the air.",
  "~Why the air has a constant composition.~ If air is a mixture and changes\nare constantly taking place which tend to modify its composition, how,\nthen, do we account for the constancy of composition which the analyses\nreveal? This is explained by several facts. (1) The changes which are\ncaused by the processes of combustion and respiration, on the one hand,\nand the action of plants, on the other, tend to equalize each other. (2)\nThe winds keep the air in constant motion and so prevent local changes.\n(3) The volume of the air is so vast and the changes which occur are so\nsmall compared with the total amount of air that they cannot be readily\ndetected. (4) Finally it must be noted that only air collected in the\nopen fields shows this constancy in composition. The air in a poorly\nventilated room occupied by a number of people rapidly changes in\ncomposition.",
  "~The properties of the air.~ Inasmuch as air is composed principally of a\nmixture of oxygen and nitrogen, which elements have already been\ndiscussed, its properties may be inferred largely from those of the two\ngases. One liter weighs 1.2923 g. It is thus 14.38 times as heavy as\nhydrogen. At the sea level it exerts an average pressure sufficient to\nsustain a column of mercury 760 mm. in height. This is taken as the\nstandard pressure in determining the volumes of gases as well as the\nboiling points of liquids. Water may be made to boil at any temperature\nbetween 0° and considerably above 100° by simply varying the pressure.\nIt is only when the pressure upon it is equal to the normal pressure of\nthe atmosphere at the sea level, as indicated by a barometric reading of\n760 mm., that it boils at 100°.",
  "~Preparation of liquid air.~ Attention has been called to the fact that\nboth oxygen and nitrogen can be obtained in the liquid state by strongly\ncooling the gases and applying great pressure to them. Since air is\nlargely a mixture of these two gases, it can be liquefied by the same\nmethods.",
  "The methods for liquefying air have been simplified greatly in\n     that the low temperature required is obtained by allowing a\n     portion of the compressed air to expand. The expansion of a gas\n     is always attended by the absorption of heat. In liquefying air\n     the apparatus is so constructed that the heat absorbed is\n     withdrawn from air already under great pressure. This process\n     is continued until the temperature is lowered to the point of\n     liquefaction.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 29]",
  "~The Dewar bulb.~ It is not possible to preserve air in the liquid state\nin a closed vessel, on account of the enormous pressure exerted by it in\nits tendency to pass into the gaseous state. It may however be preserved\nfor some hours or even days before it will completely evaporate, by\nsimply placing it in an open vessel surrounded by a nonconducting\nmaterial. The most efficient vessel for this purpose is the _Dewar bulb_\nshown in Fig. 29. The air is withdrawn from the space between the two\nwalls, thus making it nonconducting.",
  "~Properties and uses of liquid air.~ When first prepared, liquid air is\ncloudy because of the presence of particles of solid carbon dioxide.\nThese may be filtered off, leaving a liquid of slightly bluish color. It\nbegins to boil at about -190°, the nitrogen passing off first, gradually\nfollowed by the oxygen, the last portions being nearly pure oxygen. To a\ncertain extent oxygen is now prepared in this way for commercial\npurposes.",
  "The extremely low temperature of liquid air may be inferred from the\nfact that mercury when cooled by it is frozen to a mass so hard that it\nmay be used for driving nails.",
  "Liquid air is used in the preparation of oxygen and as a cooling agent\nin the study of the properties of matter at low temperatures. It has\nthus been found that elements at extremely low temperatures largely lose\ntheir chemical activity.",

  "CHAPTER IX",
  "SOLUTIONS",
  "~Definitions.~ When a substance disappears in a liquid in such a way as to\nthoroughly mix with it and to be lost to sight as an individual body,\nthe resulting liquid is called a _solution_. The liquid in which the\nsubstance dissolves is called the _solvent_, while the dissolved\nsubstance is called the _solute_.",
  "~Classes of solutions.~ Matter in any one of its physical states may\ndissolve in a liquid, so that we may have solutions of gases, of\nliquids, and of solids. Solutions of liquids in liquids are not often\nmentioned in the following pages, but the other two classes will become\nvery familiar in the course of our study, and deserve special attention.",
  "SOLUTION OF GASES IN LIQUIDS",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 30]",
  "It has already been stated that oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen are\nslightly soluble in water. Accurate study has led to the conclusion that\nall gases are soluble to some extent not only in water but in many other\nliquids. The amount of a gas which will dissolve in a liquid depends\nupon a number of conditions, and these can best be understood by\nsupposing a vessel B (Fig. 30), to be filled with the gas and inverted\nover the liquid. Under these circumstances the gas cannot escape or\nbecome mixed with another gas.",
  "~Circumstances affecting the solubility of gases.~ A number of\ncircumstances affect the solubility of a gas in a liquid.",
  "1. _Nature of the gas._ Other conditions being equal, each gas has its\nown peculiar solubility, just as it has its own special taste or odor.\nThe solubility of gases varies between wide limits, as will be seen from\nthe following table, but as a rule a given volume of a liquid will not\ndissolve more than two or three times its own volume of a gas.",
  "_Solubility of Gases in Water_",
  "1 l. of water at 760 mm. pressure and at 0° will dissolve:",
  "Ammonia                 1148.00 l.\n    Hydrochloric acid        503.00\n    Sulphur dioxide           79.79\n    Carbon dioxide             1.80\n    Oxygen                    41.14 cc.\n    Hydrogen                  21.15\n    Nitrogen                  20.03",
  "In the case of very soluble gases, such as the first three in the table,\nit is probable that chemical combination between the liquid and the gas\ntakes place.",
  "2. _Nature of the liquid._ The character of the liquid has much\ninfluence upon the solubility of a gas. Water, alcohol, and ether have\neach its own peculiar solvent power. From the solubility of a gas in\nwater, no prediction can be made as to its solubility in other liquids.",
  "3. _Influence of pressure._ It has been found that the weight of gas\nwhich dissolves in a given case is proportional to the pressure exerted\nupon the gas. If the pressure is doubled, the weight of gas going into\nsolution is doubled; if the pressure is diminished to one half of its\noriginal value, half of the dissolved gas will escape. Under high\npressure, large quantities of gas can be dissolved in a liquid, and when\nthe pressure is removed the gas escapes, causing the liquid to foam or\n_effervesce_.",
  "4. _Influence of temperature._ In general, the lower the temperature of\nthe liquid, the larger the quantity of gas which it can dissolve. 1000\nvolumes of water at 0° will dissolve 41.14 volumes of oxygen; at 50°,\n18.37 volumes; at 100° none at all. While most gases can be expelled\nfrom a liquid by boiling the solution, some cannot. For example, it is\nnot possible to expel hydrochloric acid gas completely from its solution\nby boiling.",
  "SOLUTION OF SOLIDS IN LIQUIDS",
  "This is the most familiar class of solutions, since in the laboratory\nsubstances are much more frequently used in the form of solutions than\nin the solid state.",
  "~Circumstances affecting the solubility of a solid.~ The solubility of a\nsolid in a liquid depends upon several factors.",
  "1. _Nature of the solid._ Other conditions being the same, solids vary\ngreatly in their solubility in liquids. This is illustrated in the\nfollowing table:",
  "_Table of Solubility of Solids at 18°_",
  "100 cc. of water will dissolve:",
  "Calcium chloride        71.0 g.\n    Sodium chloride         35.9\n    Potassium nitrate       29.1\n    Copper sulphate         21.4\n    Calcium sulphate         0.207",
  "No solids are absolutely insoluble, but the amount dissolved may be so\nsmall as to be of no significance for most purposes. Thus barium\nsulphate, one of the most insoluble of common substances, dissolves in\nwater to the extent of 1 part in 400,000.",
  "2. _Nature of the solvent._ Liquids vary much in their power to dissolve\nsolids. Some are said to be good solvents, since they dissolve a great\nvariety of substances and considerable quantities of them. Others have\nsmall solvent power, dissolving few substances, and those to a slight\nextent only. Broadly speaking, water is the most general solvent, and\nalcohol is perhaps second in solvent power.",
  "3. _Temperature._ The weight of a solid which a given liquid can\ndissolve varies with the temperature. Usually it increases rapidly as\nthe temperature rises, so that the boiling liquid dissolves several\ntimes the weight which the cold liquid will dissolve. In some instances,\nas in the case of common salt dissolved in water, the temperature has\nlittle influence upon the solubility, and a few solids are more soluble\nin cold water than in hot. The following examples will serve as\nillustrations:",
  "_Table of Solubility at 0° and at 100°_",
  "100 cc. of water will dissolve:",
  "At 0°           At 100°",

  "~Saturated solutions.~ A liquid will not dissolve an unlimited quantity of\na solid. On adding the solid to the liquid in small portions at a time,\nit will be found that a point is reached at which the liquid will not\ndissolve more of the solid at that temperature. The solid and the\nsolution remain in contact with each other unchanged. This condition may\nbe described by saying that they are in equilibrium with each other. A\nsolution is said to be _saturated_ when it remains unchanged in\nconcentration in contact with some of the solid. The weight of the solid\nwhich will completely saturate a definite volume of a liquid at a given\ntemperature is called the _solubility_ of the substance at that\ntemperature.",
  "~Supersaturated solutions.~ When a solution, saturated at a given\ntemperature, is allowed to cool it sometimes happens that no solid\ncrystallizes out. This is very likely to occur when the vessel used is\nperfectly smooth and the solution is not disturbed in any way. Such a\nsolution is said to be _supersaturated_. That this condition is unstable\ncan be shown by adding a crystal of the solid to the solution. All of\nthe solid in excess of the quantity required to saturate the solution at\nthis temperature will at once crystallize out, leaving the solution\nsaturated. Supersaturation may also be overcome in many cases by\nvigorously shaking or stirring the solution.",
  "~General physical properties of solutions.~ A few general statements may\nbe made in reference to the physical properties of solutions.",
  "1. _Distribution of the solid in the liquid._ A solid, when dissolved,\ntends to distribute itself uniformly through the liquid, so that every\npart of the solution has the same concentration. The process goes on\nvery slowly unless hastened by stirring or shaking the solution. Thus,\nif a few crystals of a highly colored substance such as copper sulphate\nare placed in the bottom of a tall vessel full of water, it will take\nweeks for the solution to become uniformly colored.",
  "2. _Boiling points of solutions._ The boiling point of a liquid is\nraised by the presence of a substance dissolved in it. In general the\nextent to which the boiling point of a solvent is raised by a given\nsubstance is proportional to the concentration of the solution, that\nis, to the weight of the substance dissolved in a definite weight of the\nsolvent.",
  "3. _Freezing points of solutions._ A solution freezes at a lower\ntemperature than the pure solvent. The lowering of the freezing point\nobeys the same law which holds for the raising of the boiling point: the\nextent of lowering is proportional to the weight of dissolved substance,\nthat is, to the concentration of the solution.",
  "~Electrolysis of solutions.~ Pure water does not appreciably conduct the\nelectric current. If, however, certain substances such as common salt\nare dissolved in the water, the resulting solutions are found to be\nconductors of electricity. Such solutions are called _electrolytes_.\nWhen the current passes through an electrolyte some chemical change\nalways takes place. This change is called _electrolysis_.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 31]",
  "The general method used in the electrolysis of a solution is illustrated\nin Fig. 31. The vessel D contains the electrolyte. Two plates or rods,\nA and B, made of suitable material, are connected with the wires\nfrom a battery (or dynamo) and dipped into the electrolyte, as shown in\nthe figure. These plates or rods are called _electrodes_. The electrode\nconnected with the zinc plate of the battery is the negative electrode\nor _cathode_, while that connected with the carbon plate is the positive\nelectrode or _anode_.",
  "~Theory of electrolytic dissociation.~ The facts which have just been\ndescribed in connection with solutions, together with many others, have\nled chemists to adopt a theory of solutions called _the theory of\nelectrolytic dissociation_. The main assumptions in this theory are the\nfollowing.",
  "1. _Formation of ions._ Many compounds when dissolved in water undergo\nan important change. A portion of their molecules fall apart, or\n_dissociate_, into two or more parts, called _ions_. Thus sodium nitrate\n(NaNO_{3}) dissociates into the ions Na and NO_{3}; sodium chloride,\ninto the ions Na and Cl. These ions are free to move about in the\nsolution independently of each other like independent molecules, and for\nthis reason were given the name ion, which signifies a wanderer.",
  "2. _The electrical charge of ions._ Each ion carries a heavy electrical\ncharge, and in this respect differs from an atom or molecule. It is\nevident that the sodium in the form of an ion must differ in some\nimportant way from ordinary sodium, for sodium ions, formed from sodium\nnitrate, give no visible evidence of their presence in water, whereas\nmetallic sodium at once decomposes the water. The electrical charge,\ntherefore, greatly modifies the usual chemical properties of the\nelement.",
  "3. _The positive charges equal the negative charges._ The ions formed by\nthe dissociation of any molecule are of two kinds. One kind is charged\nwith positive electricity and the other with negative electricity;\nmoreover the sum of all the positive charges is always equal to the sum\nof all the negative charges. The solution as a whole is therefore\nelectrically neutral. If we represent dissociation by the usual chemical\nequations, with the electrical charges indicated by + and - signs\nfollowing the symbols, the dissociation of sodium chloride molecules is\nrepresented thus:",
  "NaCl --> Na^{+}, Cl^{-}.",
  "The positive charge on each sodium ion exactly equals the negative\ncharge on each chlorine ion. Sodium sulphate dissociates, as shown in\nthe equation",
  "Na_{2}SO_{4} --> 2Na^{+}, SO_{4}^{--}.",
  "Here the positive charge on the two sodium ions equals the double\nnegative charge on the SO_{4} ion.",
  "4. _Not all compounds dissociate._ Only those compounds dissociate whose\nsolutions form electrolytes. Thus salt dissociates when dissolved in\nwater, the resulting solution being an electrolyte. Sugar, on the other\nhand, does not dissociate and its solution is not a conductor of the\nelectric current.",
  "5. _Extent of dissociation differs in different liquids._ While\ncompounds most readily undergo dissociation in water, yet dissociation\noften occurs to a limited extent when solution takes place in liquids\nother than water. In the discussion of solutions it will be understood\nthat the solvent is water unless otherwise noted.",
  "~The theory of electrolytic dissociation and the properties of solutions.~\nIn order to be of value, this theory must give a reasonable explanation\nof the properties of solutions. Let us now see if the theory is in\nharmony with certain of these properties.",
  "~The theory of electrolytic dissociation and the boiling and freezing\npoints of solutions.~ We have seen that the boiling point of a solution\nof a substance is raised in proportion to the concentration of the\ndissolved substance. This is but another way of saying that the change\nin the boiling point of the solution is proportional to the number of\nmolecules of the dissolved substance present in the solution.",
  "It has been found, however, that in the case of electrolytes the boiling\npoint is raised more than it should be to conform to this law. If the\nsolute dissociates into ions, the reason for this becomes clear. Each\nion has the same effect on the boiling point as a molecule, and since\ntheir number is greater than the number of molecules from which they\nwere formed, the effect on the boiling point is abnormally great.",
  "In a similar way, the theory furnishes an explanation of the abnormal\nlowering of the freezing point of electrolytes.",
  "~The theory of electrolytic dissociation and electrolysis.~ The changes\ntaking place during electrolysis harmonize very completely with the\ntheory of dissociation. This will become clear from a study of the\nfollowing examples.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 32]",
  "1. _Electrolysis of sodium chloride._ Fig. 32 represents a vessel in\nwhich the electrolyte is a solution of sodium chloride (NaCl). According\nto the dissociation theory the molecules of sodium chloride dissociate\ninto the ions Na^{+} and Cl^{-}. The Na^{+} ions are attracted to the\ncathode owing to its large negative charge. On coming into contact with\nthe cathode, the Na^{+} ions give up their positive charge and are then\nordinary sodium atoms. They immediately decompose the water according to\nthe equation",
  "Na + H_{2}O = NaOH + H,",
  "and hydrogen is evolved about the cathode.",
  "The chlorine ions on being discharged at the anode in similar manner may\neither be given off as chlorine gas, or may attack the water, as\nrepresented in the equation",
  "2Cl + H_{2}O = 2HCl + O.",
  "2. _Electrolysis of water._ The reason for the addition of sulphuric\nacid to water in the preparation of oxygen and hydrogen by electrolysis\nwill now be clear. Water itself is not an electrolyte to an appreciable\nextent; that is, it does not form enough ions to carry a current.\nSulphuric acid dissolved in water is an electrolyte, and dissociates\ninto the ions 2 H^{+} and SO_{4}^{--}. In the process of electrolysis of\nthe solution, the hydrogen ions travel to the cathode, and on being\ndischarged escape as hydrogen gas. The SO_{4} ions, when discharged at\nthe anode, act upon water, setting free oxygen and once more forming\nsulphuric acid:",
  "SO_{4} + H_{2}O = H_{2}SO_{4} + O.",
  "The sulphuric acid can again dissociate and the process repeat itself as\nlong as any water is left. Hence the hydrogen and oxygen set free in the\nelectrolysis of water really come directly from the acid but indirectly\nfrom the water.",
  "3. _Electrolysis of sodium sulphate._ In a similar way, sodium sulphate\n(Na_{2}SO_{4}), when in solution, gives the ions 2 Na^{+} and\nSO_{4}^{--}. On being discharged, the sodium atoms decompose water about\nthe cathode, as in the case of sodium chloride, while the SO_{4} ions\nwhen discharged at the anode decompose the water, as represented in the\nequation",
  "SO_{4} + H_{2}O = H_{2}SO_{4} + O",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 33]",
  "That new substances are formed at the cathode and anode may be shown in\nthe following way. A U-tube, such as is represented in Fig. 33, is\npartially filled with a solution of sodium sulphate, and the liquid in\none arm is colored with red litmus, that in the other with blue litmus.\nAn electrode placed in the red solution is made to serve as cathode,\nwhile one in the blue solution is made the anode. On allowing the\ncurrent to pass, the blue solution turns red, while the red solution\nturns blue. These are exactly the changes which would take place if\nsodium hydroxide and sulphuric acid were to be set free at the\nelectrodes, as required by the theory.",
  "~The properties of electrolytes depend upon the ions present.~ When a\nsubstance capable of dissociating into ions is dissolved in water, the\nproperties of the solution will depend upon two factors: (1) the ions\nformed from the substance; (2) the undissociated molecules. Since the\nions are usually more active chemically than the molecules, most of the\nchemical properties of an electrolyte are due to the ions rather than to\nthe molecules.",
  "The solutions of any two substances which give the same ion will have\ncertain properties in common. Thus all solutions containing the copper\nion (Cu^{++}) are blue, unless the color is modified by the presence of\nions or molecules having some other color.",
  "EXERCISES",

  "CHAPTER X",
  "ACIDS, BASES, AND SALTS; NEUTRALIZATION",
  "~Acids, bases, and salts.~ The three classes of compounds known\nrespectively as acids, bases, and salts include the great majority of\nthe compounds with which we shall have to deal. It is important,\ntherefore, for us to consider each of these classes in a systematic way.\nThe individual members belonging to each class will be discussed in\ndetail in the appropriate places, but a few representatives of each\nclass will be described in this chapter with special reference to the\ncommon properties in accordance with which they are classified.",
  "~The familiar acids.~ _Hydrochloric acid_ is a gas composed of hydrogen and\nchlorine, and has the formula HCl. The substance is very soluble in\nwater, and it is this solution which is usually called hydrochloric\nacid. _Nitric acid_ is a liquid composed of hydrogen, nitrogen, and\noxygen, having the formula HNO_{3}. As sold commercially it is mixed\nwith about 32% of water. _Sulphuric acid_, whose composition is\nrepresented by the formula H_{2}SO_{4}, is an oily liquid nearly twice\nas heavy as water, and is commonly called _oil of vitriol_.",
  "~Characteristics of acids.~ (1) All acids contain hydrogen. (2) When\ndissolved in water the molecules of the acid dissociate into two kinds\nof ions. One of these is always hydrogen and is the cation (+), while\nthe other consists of the remainder of the molecule and is the anion\n(-). (3) The solution tastes sour. (4) It has the power to change the\ncolor of certain substances called _indicators_. Thus blue litmus is\nchanged to red, and yellow methyl orange is changed to red. Since all\nacids produce hydrogen cations, while the anions of each are different,\nthe properties which all acids have in common when in solution, such as\ntaste and action on indicators, must be attributed to the hydrogen ions.",
  "DEFINITION: _An acid is a substance which produces hydrogen ions when\ndissolved in water or other dissociating liquids._",
  "~Undissociated acids.~ When acids are perfectly free from water, or are\ndissolved in liquids like benzene which do not have the power of\ndissociating them into ions, they should have no real acid properties.\nThis is found to be the case. Under these circumstances they do not\naffect the color of indicators or have any of the properties\ncharacteristic of acids.",
  "The familiar bases. The bases most used in the laboratory are sodium\nhydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), and calcium hydroxide\n(Ca(OH)_{2}). These are white solids, soluble in water, the latter\nsparingly so. Some bases are very difficultly soluble in water. The very\nsoluble ones with most pronounced basic properties are sometimes called\nthe _alkalis_.",
  "~Characteristics of bases.~ (1) All bases contain hydrogen and oxygen. (2)\nWhen dissolved in water the molecules of the base dissociate into two\nkinds of ions. One of these is always composed of oxygen and hydrogen\nand is the anion. It has the formula OH and is called the _hydroxyl\nion_. The remainder of the molecule, which usually consists of a single\natom, is the cation. (3) The solution of a base has a soapy feel and a\nbrackish taste. (4) It reverses the color change produced in indicators\nby acids, turning red litmus blue, and red methyl orange yellow. Since\nall bases produce hydroxyl anions, while the cations of each are\ndifferent, the properties which all bases have in common when in\nsolution must be due to the hydroxyl ions.",
  "DEFINITION: _A base is a substance which produces hydroxyl ions when\ndissolved in water or other dissociating liquids._",
  "~Undissociated bases.~ Bases, in the absence of water or when dissolved in\nliquids which do not dissociate them, should have none of the properties\ncharacteristic of this class of substances. This has been found to be\nthe case. For example, they have no effect upon indicators under these\ncircumstances.",
  "~Neutralization.~ When an acid and a base are brought together in solution\nin proper proportion, the characteristic properties of each disappear.\nThe solution tastes neither sour nor brackish; it has no effect upon\nindicators. There can therefore be neither hydrogen nor hydroxyl ions\npresent in the solution. A study of reactions of this kind has shown\nthat the hydrogen ions of the acid combine with the hydroxyl ions of the\nbase to form molecules of water, water being a substance which is not\nappreciably dissociated into ions. This action of an acid on a base is\ncalled _neutralization_. The following equations express the\nneutralization of the three acids by three bases, water being formed in\neach case.",
  "Na^{+}, OH^{-} + H^{+}, Cl^{-} = Na^{+}, Cl^{-} + H_{2}O.",
  "K^{+}, OH^{-} + H^{+}, NO_{3}^{-} = K^{+}, NO_{3}^{-} + H_{2}O.",
  "Ca^{++}, (OH)_{2}^{--} + H_{2}^{++}, SO_{4}^{--}\n         = Ca^{++}, SO_{4}^{--} + 2H_{2}O.",
  "DEFINITION: _Neutralization consists in the union of the hydrogen ion of\nan acid with the hydroxyl ion of a base to form water._",
  "~Salts.~ It will be noticed that in neutralization the anion of the acid\nand the cation of the base are not changed. If, however, the water is\nexpelled by evaporation, these two ions slowly unite, and when the water\nbecomes saturated with the substance so produced, it separates in the\nform of a solid called a _salt_.",
  "DEFINITION: _A salt is a substance formed by the union of the anion of\nan acid with the cation of a base._",
  "~Characteristics of salts.~ (1) From the definition of a salt it will be\nseen that there is no element or group of elements which characterize\nsalts. (2) Salts as a class have no peculiar taste. (3) In the absence\nof all other substances they are without action on indicators. (4) When\ndissolved in water they form two kinds of ions.",
  "~Heat of neutralization.~ If neutralization is due to the union\n     of hydrogen ions with hydroxyl ions, and nothing more, it\n     follows that when a given weight of water is formed in\n     neutralization, the heat set free should always be the same, no\n     matter from what acid and base the two kinds of ions have been\n     supplied. Careful experiments have shown that this is the case,\n     provided no other reactions take place at the same time. When\n     18g. of water are formed in neutralization, 13,700 cal. of heat\n     are set free. This is represented in the equations",
  "Na^{+}, OH^{-} + H^{+}, Cl^{-}\n         = Na^{+}, Cl^{-} + H_{2}O + 13,700 cal.",
  "K^{+}, OH^{-} + H^{+}, NO_{3}^{-}\n         = K^{+}, NO_{3}^{-} + H_{2}O + 13,700 cal.",
  "Ca^{++}, (OH)_{2}^{--} + H_{2}^{++}, SO_{4}^{--}\n         = Ca^{++}, SO_{4}^{--} + 2H_{2}O + 2 × 13,700 cal.",
  "~Neutralization a quantitative act.~ Since neutralization is a definite\nchemical act, each acid will require a perfectly definite weight of each\nbase for its neutralization. For example, a given weight of sulphuric\nacid will always require a definite weight of sodium hydroxide, in\naccordance with the equation",
  "H_{2}, SO_{4} + 2Na, OH = Na_{2}, SO_{4} + 2H_{2}O.",
  "~Determination of the ratio in neutralization.~ The quantities of\n     acid and base required in neutralization may be determined in\n     the following way. Dilute solutions of the two substances are\n     prepared, the sulphuric acid being placed in one of the\n     burettes (Fig. 34) and the sodium hydroxide in the other. The\n     levels of the two liquids are then brought to the zero marks of\n     the burettes by means of the stopcocks. A measured volume of\n     the acid is drawn off into a beaker, a few drops of litmus\n     solution added, and the sodium hydroxide is run in drop by drop\n     until the red litmus just turns blue. The volume of the sodium\n     hydroxide consumed is then noted. If the concentrations of the\n     two solutions are known, it is easy to calculate what weight of\n     sodium hydroxide is required to neutralize a given weight of\n     sulphuric acid. By evaporating the neutralized solution to\n     dryness, the weight of the sodium sulphate formed can be\n     determined directly. Experiment shows that the weights are\n     always in accordance with the equation in the preceding\n     paragraph.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 34]",
  "~Extent of dissociation.~ The question will naturally arise, When an acid,\nbase, or salt dissolves in water, do all the molecules dissociate into\nions, or only a part of them? The experiments by which this question can\nbe answered cannot be described here. It has been found, however, that\nonly a fraction of the molecules dissociate. The percentage which will\ndissociate in a given case depends upon several conditions, the chief of\nwhich are: (1) The concentration of the solution. In concentrated\nsolutions only a very small percentage of dissociation occurs. As the\nsolution is diluted the percentage increases, and in very dilute\nsolutions it may be very large, though it is never complete in any\nordinary solution. (2) The nature of the dissolved compound. At equal\nconcentrations substances differ much among themselves in the percentage\nof dissociation. The great majority of salts are about equally\ndissociated. Acids and bases, on the contrary, show great differences.\nSome are freely dissociated, while others are dissociated to but a\nslight extent.",
  "~Strength of acids and bases.~ Since acid and basic properties are due to\nhydrogen and hydroxyl ions respectively, the acid or base which will\nproduce the greatest percentage of these ions at a given concentration\nmust be regarded as the strongest representative of its class. The acids\nand bases described in the foregoing paragraphs are all quite strong. In\n10% solutions they are dissociated to about 50%, and this is also\napproximately the extent to which most salts are dissociated at this\nsame concentration.",
  "~Partial neutralization.~ 1. _Basic salts._ The chemical action\n     between an acid and a base is not always as complete as has\n     been represented in the foregoing paragraphs. For example, if\n     the base magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)_{2}) and hydrochloric acid\n     (HCl) are brought together in the ratio of an equal number of\n     molecules of each, there will be only half enough hydrogen ions\n     for the hydroxyl ions present.",
  "Mg, (OH)_{2} + H, Cl = Mg, OH, Cl + H_{2}O.",
  "Magnesium, hydroxyl, and chlorine ions are left at the close of\n     the reaction, and under the proper conditions unite to form\n     molecules of the compound Mg(OH)Cl. This compound, when\n     dissolved, can form hydroxyl ions and therefore possesses basic\n     properties; it can also form the ions of a salt (Mg and Cl),\n     and has properties characteristic of salts. Substances of this\n     kind are called _basic salts._",
  "DEFINITION: _A basic salt is a substance which can give the\n     ions both of a base and of a salt when dissolved in water._",
  "2. _Acid salts._ In a similar way, when sulphuric acid and\n     sodium hydroxide are brought together in the ratio of equal\n     numbers of the molecules of each, it is possible to have a\n     reaction expressed by the equation",
  "Na, OH + H_{2}, SO_{4} = Na, H, SO_{4} + H_{2}O.",
  "The ions remaining after all the hydroxyl ions have been used\n     up are those of an acid (H) and those of a salt (Na and\n     SO_{4}). These unite to form the substance NaHSO_{4}, and as\n     the solution becomes saturated with this substance through\n     evaporation, it separates in the form of crystals. In solution\n     this substance can give hydrogen ions, and therefore possesses\n     acid properties; it can also give the ions characteristic of a\n     salt. It is therefore called an _acid salt_.",
  "DEFINITION: _An acid salt is one which can give the ions of an\n     acid and of a salt when in solution._",
  "3. _Normal salts._ Salts which are the products of complete\n     neutralization, such as Na_{2}SO_{4}, and which in solution can\n     give neither hydrogen nor hydroxyl ions, but only the ions of a\n     salt, are called _normal salts_ to distinguish them from acid\n     and basic salts.",
  "~Methods of expressing reactions between compounds in solution.~ Chemical\nequations representing reactions between substances in solution may\nrepresent the details of the reaction, or they may simply indicate the\nfinal products formed. In the latter case the formation of ions is not\nindicated. Thus, if we wish to call attention to the details of the\nreaction between sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid in solution, the\nequation is written as follows:",
  "Na^{+}, OH^{-} + H^{+}, Cl^{-} = Na^{+}, Cl^{-} + H_{2}O.",
  "On the other hand, if we wish simply to represent the final products\nformed, the following is used.",
  "NaOH + HCl = NaCl + H_{2}O.",
  "Both of these methods will therefore be used:",
  "~Radicals.~ It has been emphasized that the hydroxyl group (OH) always\nforms the anion of a base, while the group NO_{3} forms the anion of\nnitric acid and sodium nitrate; the group SO_{4}, the anion of sulphuric\nacid and calcium sulphate. A group of elements which in this way\nconstitutes a part of a molecule, acting as a unit in a chemical change,\nor forming ions in solution, is called a _radical_. Some of these\nradicals have been given special names, the names signifying the\nelements present in the radical. Thus we have the hydroxyl radical (OH)\nand the nitrate radical (NO_{3}).",
  "DEFINITION: _A radical is a group of elements forming part of a\nmolecule, and acting as a unit in chemical reactions._",
  "~Names of acids, bases, and salts.~ Since acids, bases, and salts are so\nintimately related to each other, it is very advantageous to give names\nto the three classes in accordance with some fixed system. The system\nuniversally adopted is as follows:",
  "~Naming of bases.~ All bases are called _hydroxides_. They are\ndistinguished from each other by prefixing the name of the element which\nis in combination with the hydroxyl group. Examples: sodium hydroxide\n(NaOH); calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)_{2}); copper hydroxide (Cu(OH)_{2}).",
  "~Naming of acids.~ The method of naming acids depends upon whether the\nacid consists of two elements or three.",
  "1. _Binary acids._ Acids containing only one element in addition to\nhydrogen are called _binary acids_. They are given names consisting of\nthe prefix _hydro-_, the name of the second element present, and the\ntermination _-ic_. Examples: hydrochloric acid (HCl); hydrosulphuric\nacid (H_{2}S).",
  "2. _Ternary acids._ In addition to the two elements present in binary\nacids, the great majority of acids also contain oxygen. They therefore\nconsist of three elements and are called _ternary acids_. It usually\nhappens that the same three elements can unite in different proportions\nto make several different acids. The most familiar one of these is given\na name ending in the suffix _-ic_, while the one with less oxygen is\ngiven a similar name, but ending in the suffix _-ous_. Examples: nitric\nacid (HNO_{3}); nitrous acid (HNO_{2}). In cases where more than two\nacids are known, use is made of prefixes in addition to the two suffixes\n_-ic_ and _-ous_. Thus the prefix _per-_ signifies an acid still richer\nin oxygen; the prefix _hypo-_ signifies one with less oxygen.",
  "~Naming of salts.~ A salt derived from a binary acid is given a name\nconsisting of the names of the two elements composing it, with the\ntermination _-ide_. Example: sodium chloride (NaCl). All other binary\ncompounds are named in the same way.",
  "A salt of a ternary acid is named in accordance with the acid from which\nit is derived. A ternary acid with the termination _-ic_ gives a salt\nwith the name ending in _-ate_, while an acid with termination _-ous_\ngives a salt with the name ending in _-ite_.

  "It will be noticed that while one atom of chlorine combines with one\natom of hydrogen, an atom of oxygen combines with two, an atom of\nnitrogen with three, one of carbon with four. The number which expresses\nthis combining ratio between atoms is a definite property of each\nelement and is called its _valence_.",
  "DEFINITION: _The valence of an element is that property which determines\nthe number of the atoms of another element which its atom can hold in\ncombination._",
  "~Valence a numerical property.~ Valence is therefore merely a numerical\nrelation and does not convey any information in regard to the intensity\nof the affinity between atoms. Judging by the heat liberated in their\nunion, oxygen has a far stronger affinity for hydrogen than does\nnitrogen, but an atom of oxygen can combine with two atoms only of\nhydrogen, while an atom of nitrogen can combine with three.",
  "~Measure of valence.~ In expressing the valence of an element we must\nselect some standard for comparison, just as in the measurement of any\nother numerical quantity. It has been found that an atom of hydrogen is\nnever able to hold in combination more than one atom of any other\nelement. Hydrogen is therefore taken as the standard, and other elements\nare compared with it in determining their valence. A number of other\nelements are like hydrogen in being able to combine with at most one\natom of other elements, and such elements are called _univalent_. Among\nthese are chlorine, iodine, and sodium. Elements such as oxygen,\ncalcium, and zinc, which can combine with two atoms of hydrogen or other\nunivalent elements, are said to be _divalent_. Similarly, we have\n_trivalent, tetravalent, pentavalent_ elements. None have a valence of\nmore than 8.",
  "~Indirect measure of valence.~ Many elements, especially among the metals,\ndo not readily form compounds with hydrogen, and their valence is not\neasy to determine by direct comparison with the standard element. These\nelements, however, combine with other univalent elements, such as\nchlorine, and their valence can be determined from the compounds so\nformed.",
  "~Variable valence.~ Many elements are able to exert different valences\nunder differing circumstances. Thus we have the compounds Cu_{2}O and\nCuO, CO and CO_{2}, FeCl_{2} and FeCl_{3}. It is not always possible to\nassign a fixed valence to an element. Nevertheless each element tends to\nexert some normal valence, and the compounds in which it has a valence\ndifferent from this are apt to be unstable and easily changed into\ncompounds in which the valence of the element is normal. The valences of\nthe various elements will become familiar as the elements are studied in\ndetail.",
  "~Valence and combining ratios.~ When elements combine to form compounds,\nthe ratio in which they combine will be determined by their valences. In\nthose compounds which consist of two elements directly combined, the\nunion is between such numbers of the two atoms as have equal valences.\nElements of the same valence will therefore combine atom for atom.\nDesignating the valence of the atoms by Roman numerals placed above\ntheir symbols, we have the formulas",
  "II II   II III   III   IV IV\n    HCl,     ZnO,     BN,   CSi.",
  "A divalent element, on the other hand, will combine with two atoms of a\nunivalent element. Thus we have",
  "II II         II II\n    ZnCl_{2} and H_{2}O",
  "(the numerals above each symbol representing the sum of the valences of\nthe atoms of the element present). A trivalent atom will combine with\nthree atoms of a univalent element, as in the compound",
  "III III\n     H_{3}N.",
  "If a trivalent element combines with a divalent element, the union will\nbe between two atoms of the trivalent element and three of the divalent\nelement, since these numbers are the smallest which have equal valences.\nThus the oxide of the trivalent metal aluminium has the formula\nAl_{2}O_{3}. Finally one atom of a tetravalent element such as carbon\nwill combine with four atoms of a univalent element, as in the compound\nCH_{4}, or with two atoms of a divalent element, as in the compound\nCO_{2}.",
  "We have no knowledge as to why elements differ in their combining power,\nand there is no way to determine their valences save by experiment.",
  "~Valence and the structure of compounds.~ Compounds will be met\n     from time to time which are apparent exceptions to the general\n     statements just made in regard to valence. Thus, from the\n     formula for hydrogen dioxide (H_{2}O_{2}), it might be\n     supposed that the oxygen is univalent; yet it is certainly\n     divalent in water (H_{2}O). That it may also be divalent in\n     H_{2}O_{2} may be made clear as follows: The unit valence of\n     each element may be represented graphically by a line attached\n     to its symbol. Univalent hydrogen and divalent oxygen will then\n     have the symbols H- and -O-. When atoms combine, each unit\n     valence of one atom combines with a unit valence of another\n     atom. Thus the composition of water may be expressed by the\n     formula H-O-H, which is meant to show that each of the unit\n     valences of oxygen is satisfied with the unit valence of a\n     single hydrogen atom.",
  "The chemical conduct of hydrogen dioxide leads to the\n     conclusion that the two oxygen atoms of its molecule are in\n     direct combination with each other, and in addition each is in\n     combination with a hydrogen atom. This may be expressed by the\n     formula H-O-O-H. The oxygen in the compound is therefore\n     divalent, just as it is in water. It will thus be seen that the\n     structure of a compound must be known before the valences of\n     the atoms making up the compound can be definitely decided\n     upon.",
  "Such formulas as H-O-H and H-O-O-H are known as _structural\n     formulas_, because they are intended to show what is known in\n     regard to the arrangement of the atoms in the molecules.",
  "~Valence and the replacing power of atoms.~ Just as elements having the\nsame valence combine with each other atom for atom, so if they replace\neach other in a chemical reaction they will do so in the same ratio.\nThis is seen in the following equations, in which a univalent hydrogen\natom is replaced by a univalent sodium atom:",
  "NaOH + HCl = NaCl + H_{2}O.",
  "2NaOH + H_{2}SO_{4} = Na_{2}SO_{4} + 2H_{2}O.",
  "Na + H_{2}O = NaOH + H.",
  "Similarly, one atom of divalent calcium will replace two atoms of\nunivalent hydrogen or one of divalent zinc:",
  "Ca(OH)_{2} + 2 HCl = CaCl_{2} + 2H_{2}O.",
  "CaCl_{2} + ZnSO_{4} = CaSO_{4} + ZnCl_{2}.",
  "In like manner, one atom of a trivalent element will replace three of a\nunivalent element, or two atoms will replace three atoms of a divalent\nelement.",
  "~Valence and its applications to formulas of salts.~ While the true nature\nof valence is not understood and many questions connected with the\nsubject remain unanswered, yet many of the main facts are of much help\nto the student. Thus the formula of a salt, differs from that of the\nacid from which it is derived in that the hydrogen of the acid has been\nreplaced by a metal. If, then, it is known that a given metal forms a\nnormal salt with a certain acid, the formula of the salt can at once be\ndetermined if the valence of the metal is known. Since sodium is\nunivalent, the sodium salts of the acids HCl and H_{2}SO_{4} will be\nrespectively NaCl and Na_{2}SO_{4}. One atom of divalent zinc will\nreplace 2 hydrogen atoms, so that the corresponding zinc salts will be\nZnCl_{2} and ZnSO_{4}.",
  "The formula for aluminium sulphate is somewhat more difficult to\ndetermine. Aluminium is trivalent, and the simplest ratio in which the\naluminium atom can replace the hydrogen in sulphuric acid is 2 atoms of\naluminium (6 valences) to 3 molecules of sulphuric acid (6 hydrogen\natoms). The formula of the sulphate will then be Al_{2}(SO_{4})_{3}.",
  "~Valence and its application to equation writing.~ It will be readily seen\nthat a knowledge of valence is also of very great assistance in writing\nthe equations for reactions of double decomposition. Thus, in the\ngeneral reaction between an acid and a base, the essential action is\nbetween the univalent hydrogen ion and the univalent hydroxyl ion. The\nbase and the acid must always be taken in such proportions as to secure\nan equal number of each of these ions. Thus, in the reaction between\nferric hydroxide (Fe(OH)_{3}) and sulphuric acid (H_{2}SO_{4}), it will\nbe necessary to take 2 molecules of the former and 3 of the latter in\norder to have an equal number of the two ions, namely, 6. The equation\nwill then be",
  "2Fe(OH)_{3} + 3H_{2}SO_{4} = Fe_{2}(SO_{4})_{3} + 6H_{2}O.",
  "Under certain conditions the salts Al_{2}(SO_{4})_{3} and CaCl_{2}\nundergo double decomposition, the two metals, aluminium and calcium,\nexchanging places. The simplest ratio of exchange in this case is 2\natoms of aluminium (6 valences) and 3 atoms of calcium (6 valences).\nThe reaction will therefore take place between 1 molecule of\nAl_{2}(SO_{4})_{3} and 3 of CaCl_{2}, and the equation is as follows:",
  "Al_{2}(SO_{4})_{3} + 3 CaCl_{2} = 3CaSO_{4} + 2AlCl_{3}.",

  "COMPOUNDS OF NITROGEN",
  "~Occurrence.~ As has been stated in a former chapter, nitrogen constitutes\na large fraction of the atmosphere. The compounds of nitrogen, however,\ncannot readily be obtained from this source, since at any ordinary\ntemperature nitrogen is able to combine directly with very few of the\nelements.",
  "In certain forms of combination nitrogen occurs in the soil from which\nit is taken up by plants and built into complex substances composed\nchiefly of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. Animals feeding on\nthese plants assimilate the nitrogenous matter, so that this element is\nan essential constituent of both plants and animals.",
  "~Decomposition of organic matter by bacteria.~ When living matter dies and\nundergoes decay complicated chemical reactions take place, one result of\nwhich is that the nitrogen of the organic matter is set free either as\nthe element nitrogen, or in the form of simple compounds, such as\nammonia (NH_{3}) or oxides of nitrogen. Experiment has shown that all\nsuch processes of decay are due to the action of different kinds of\nbacteria, each particular kind effecting a different change.",
  "~Decomposition of organic matter by heat.~ When organic matter is strongly\nheated decomposition into simpler substances takes place in much the\nsame way as in the case of bacterial decomposition. Coal is a complex\nsubstance of vegetable origin, consisting largely of carbon, but also\ncontaining hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. When this is heated in a\nclosed vessel so that air is excluded, about one seventh of the nitrogen\nis converted into ammonia, and this is the chief source from which\nammonia and its compounds are obtained.",
  "COMPOUNDS OF NITROGEN WITH HYDROGEN",
  "~Ammonia~ (NH_{3}). Several compounds consisting exclusively of nitrogen\nand hydrogen are known, but only one, ammonia, need be considered here.",
  "~Preparation of ammonia.~ Ammonia is prepared in the laboratory by a\ndifferent method from the one which is used commercially.",
  "1. _Laboratory method._ In the laboratory ammonia is prepared from\nammonium chloride, a compound having the formula NH_{4}Cl, and obtained\nin the manufacture of coal gas. As will be shown later in the chapter,\nthe group NH_{4} in this compound acts as a univalent radical and is\nknown as _ammonium_. When ammonium chloride is warmed with sodium\nhydroxide, the ammonium and sodium change places, the reaction being\nexpressed in the following equation.",
  "NH_{4}Cl + NaOH = NaCl + NH_{4}OH.",
  "The ammonium hydroxide (NH_{4}OH) so formed is unstable and breaks down\ninto water and ammonia.",
  "NH_{4}OH = NH_{3} + H_{2}O.",
  "Calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)_{2}) is frequently used in place of the more\nexpensive sodium hydroxide, the equations being",
  "2NH_{4}Cl + Ca(OH)_{2} = CaCl_{2} + 2NH_{4}OH,",
  "2NH_{4}OH = 2H_{2}O + 2NH_{3}.",
  "In the preparation, the ammonium chloride and calcium hydroxide\n     are mixed together and placed in a flask arranged as shown in\n     Fig. 35. The mixture is gently warmed, when ammonia is evolved\n     as a gas and is collected by displacement of air.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 35]",
  "2. _Commercial method._ Nearly all the ammonia of commerce comes from\nthe gasworks. Ordinary illuminating gas is made by distilling coal, as\nwill be explained later, and among the products of this distillation a\nsolution of ammonia in water is obtained. This solution, known as _gas\nliquor_, contains not only ammonia but other soluble substances. Most of\nthese combine chemically with lime, while ammonia does not; if then lime\nis added to the gas liquor and the liquor is heated, the ammonia is\ndriven out from the mixture. It may be dissolved again in pure, cold\nwater, forming _aqua ammonia_, or the ammonia water of commerce.",
  "~Preparation from hydrogen and nitrogen.~ When electric sparks\n     are passed for some time through a mixture of hydrogen and\n     nitrogen, a small percentage of the two elements in the mixture\n     is changed into ammonia. The action soon ceases, however, for\n     the reason that ammonia is decomposed by the electric\n     discharge. The reaction expressed in the equation",
  "N + 3H = NH_{3}",
  "can therefore go in either direction depending upon the\n     relative quantities of the substances present. This recalls the\n     similar change from oxygen into ozone, which soon ceases\n     because the ozone is in turn decomposed into oxygen.",
  "~Physical properties.~ Under ordinary conditions ammonia is a gas whose\ndensity is 0.59. It is therefore little more than half as heavy as air.\nIt is easily condensed into a colorless liquid, and can now be purchased\nin liquid form in steel cylinders. The gas is colorless and has a\nstrong, suffocating odor. It is extremely soluble in water, 1 l. of\nwater at 0° and 760 mm. pressure dissolving 1148 l. of the gas. In\ndissolving this large volume of gas the water expands considerably, so\nthat the density of the solution is less than that of water, the\nstrongest solutions having a density of 0.88.",
  "~Chemical properties.~ Ammonia will not support combustion, nor will it\nburn under ordinary conditions. In an atmosphere of oxygen it burns with\na feeble, yellowish flame. When quite dry it is not a very active\nsubstance, but when moist it combines with a great many substances,\nparticularly with acids.",
  "~Uses.~ It has been stated that ammonia can be condensed to a liquid by\nthe application of pressure. If the pressure is removed from the liquid\nso obtained, it rapidly passes again into the gaseous state and in so\ndoing absorbs a large amount of heat. Advantage is taken of this fact in\nthe preparation of artificial ice. Large quantities of ammonia are also\nused in the preparation of ammonium compounds.",
  "~The manufacture of artificial ice.~ Fig. 36 illustrates the\n     method of preparing artificial ice. The ammonia gas is\n     liquefied in the pipes X by means of the pump Y. The heat\n     generated is absorbed by water flowing over the pipes. The\n     pipes lead into a large brine tank, a cross section of which is\n     shown in the figure. Into the brine (concentrated solution of\n     common salt) contained in this tank are dipped the vessels A,\n     B, C, filled with pure water. The pressure is removed from\n     the liquid ammonia as it passes into the pipes immersed in the\n     brine, and the heat absorbed by the rapid evaporation of the\n     liquid lowers the temperature of the brine below zero. The\n     water in A, B, C is thereby frozen into cakes of ice. The\n     gaseous ammonia resulting from the evaporation of the liquid\n     ammonia is again condensed, so that the process is continuous.",
  "[Illustration Fig. 36]",
  "~Ammonium hydroxide~ (NH_{4}OH). The solution of ammonia in water is found\nto have strong basic properties and therefore contains hydroxyl ions. It\nturns red litmus blue; it has a soapy feel; it neutralizes acids,\nforming salts with them. It seems probable, therefore, that when ammonia\ndissolves in water it combines chemically with it according to the\nequation",
  "NH_{3} + H_{2}O = NH_{4}OH,",
  "and that it is the substance NH_{4}OH, called ammonium hydroxide, which\nhas the basic properties, dissociating into the ions NH_{4} and OH.\nAmmonium hydroxide has never been obtained in a pure state. At every\nattempt to isolate it the substance breaks up into water and ammonia,--",
  "NH_{4}OH = NH_{3} + H_{2}O.",
  "~The ammonium radical.~ The radical NH_{4} plays the part of a metal in\nmany chemical reactions and is called ammonium. The ending _-ium_ is\ngiven to the name to indicate the metallic properties of the substance,\nsince the names of the metals in general have that ending. The salts\nformed by the action of the base ammonium hydroxide on acids are called\nammonium salts. Thus, with hydrochloric acid, ammonium chloride is\nformed in accordance with the equation",
  "NH_{4}OH + HCl = NH_{4}Cl + H_{2}O.",
  "Similarly, with nitric acid, ammonium nitrate (NH_{4}NO_{3}) is formed,\nand with sulphuric acid, ammonium sulphate ((NH_{4})_{2}S0_{4}).",
  "It will be noticed that in the neutralization of ammonium hydroxide by\nacids the group NH_{4} replaces one hydrogen atom of the acid, just as\nsodium does. The group therefore acts as a univalent metal.",
  "~Combination of nitrogen with hydrogen by volume.~ Under suitable\nconditions ammonia can be decomposed into nitrogen and hydrogen by\npassing electric sparks through the gas. Accurate measurement has shown\nthat when ammonia is decomposed, two volumes of the gas yield one volume\nof nitrogen and three volumes of hydrogen. Consequently, if the two\nelements were to combine directly, one volume of nitrogen would combine\nwith three volumes of hydrogen to form two volumes of ammonia. Here, as\nin the formation of steam from hydrogen and oxygen, small whole numbers\nserve to indicate the relation between the volumes of combining gases\nand that of the gaseous product.",
  "COMPOUNDS OF NITROGEN WITH OXYGEN AND HYDROGEN",
  "In addition to ammonium hydroxide, nitrogen forms several compounds with\nhydrogen and oxygen, of which nitric acid (HNO_{3}) and nitrous acid\n(HNO_{2}) are the most familiar.",
  "~Nitric acid~ (HNO_{3}). Nitric acid is not found to any extent in nature,\nbut some of its salts, especially sodium nitrate (NaNO_{3}) and\npotassium nitrate (KNO_{3}) are found in large quantities. From these\nsalts nitric acid can be obtained.",
  "[Illustration Fig. 37]",
  "~Preparation of nitric acid.~ When sodium nitrate is treated with\nconcentrated cold sulphuric acid, no chemical action seems to take\nplace. If, however, the mixture is heated in a retort, nitric acid is\ngiven off as a vapor and may be easily condensed to a liquid by passing\nthe vapor into a tube surrounded by cold water, as shown in Fig. 37. An\nexamination of the liquid left in the retort shows that it contains\nsodium acid sulphate (NaHSO_{4}), so that the reaction may be\nrepresented by the equation",

  "~Chemical properties.~ The most important chemical properties of nitric\nacid are the following.",
  "1. _Acid properties._ As the name indicates, this substance is an acid,\nand has all the properties of that class of substances. It changes blue\nlitmus red and has a sour taste in dilute solutions. It forms hydrogen\nions in solution and neutralizes bases forming salts. It also acts upon\nthe oxides of most metals, forming a salt and water. It is one of the\nstrongest acids.",
  "2. _Decomposition on heating._ When boiled, or exposed for some time to\nsunlight, it suffers a partial decomposition according to the equation",
  "2HNO_{3} = H_{2}O + 2NO_{2} + O.",
  "The substance NO_{2}, called nitrogen peroxide, is a brownish gas, which\nis readily soluble in water and in nitric acid. It therefore dissolves\nin the undecomposed acid, and imparts a yellowish or reddish color to\nit. Concentrated nitric acid highly charged with this substance is\ncalled _fuming nitric acid_.",
  "3. _Oxidizing action._ According to its formula, nitric acid contains a\nlarge percentage of oxygen, and the reaction just mentioned shows that\nthe compound is not a very stable one, easily undergoing decomposition.\nThese properties should make it a good oxidizing agent, and we find that\nthis is the case. Under ordinary circumstances, when acting as an\noxidizing agent, it is decomposed according to the equation",
  "2HNO_{3} = H_{2}O + 2NO + 3O.",
  "The oxygen is taken up by the substance oxidized, and not set free, as\nis indicated in the equation. Thus, if carbon is oxidized by nitric\nacid, the oxygen combines with carbon, forming carbon dioxide (CO_{2}):",
  "C + 2O = CO_{2}.",
  "4. _Action on metals._ We have seen that when an acid acts upon a metal\nhydrogen is set free. Accordingly, when nitric acid acts upon a metal,\nsuch as copper, we should expect the reaction to take place which is\nexpressed in the equation",
  "Cu + 2HNO_{3} = Cu(NO_{3})_{2} + 2H.",
  "This reaction does take place, but the hydrogen set free is immediately\noxidized to water by another portion of the nitric acid according to the\nequation",

  "As these two equations are written, two atoms of hydrogen are given off\nin the first equation, while three are used up in the second. In order\nthat the hydrogen may be equal in the two equations, we must multiply\nthe first by 3 and the second by 2. We shall then have",
  "3Cu + 6HNO_{3} = 3Cu(NO_{3})_{2} + 6H,",
  "2HNO_{3} + 6H = 4H_{2}O + 2NO.",
  "The two equations may now be combined into one by adding the quantities\non each side of the equality sign, canceling the hydrogen which is given\noff in the one reaction and used up in the other. We shall then have the\nequation",

  "~Importance of steps in a reaction.~ This complete equation has\n     the advantage of making it possible to calculate very easily\n     the proportions in which the various substances enter into the\n     reaction or are formed in it. It is unsatisfactory in that it\n     does not give full information about the way in which the\n     reaction takes place. For example, it does not suggest that\n     hydrogen is at first formed, and subsequently transformed into\n     water.

  "Nitric oxide is most conveniently prepared in this way. The metal is\nplaced in the flask A (Fig. 39) and the acid added slowly through the\nfunnel tube B. The gas escapes through C and is collected over\nwater.",
  "Pure nitric oxide is a colorless gas, slightly heavier than air, and is\npractically insoluble in water. It is a difficult gas to liquefy. Unlike\nnitrous oxide, nitric oxide does not part with its oxygen easily, and\nburning substances introduced into this gas are usually extinguished. A\nfew substances like phosphorus, which have a very strong affinity for\noxygen and which are burning energetically in the air, will continue to\nburn in an atmosphere of nitric oxide. In this case the nitric oxide\nloses all of its oxygen and the nitrogen is set free as gas.",
  "~Action of nitric oxide with oxygen.~ When nitric oxide comes into contact\nwith oxygen or with the air, it at once combines with the oxygen even at\nordinary temperatures, forming a reddish-yellow gas of the formula\nNO_{2}, which is called nitrogen peroxide. This action is not energetic\nenough to produce a flame, though considerable heat is set free.",
  "~Nitrogen peroxide~ (NO_{2}). This gas, as we have just seen, is formed by\nallowing nitric oxide to come into contact with oxygen. It can also be\nmade by heating certain nitrates, such as lead nitrate:",
  "Pb(NO_{3})_{2} = PbO + 2NO_{2} + O.",
  "It is a reddish-yellow gas of unpleasant odor, which is quite poisonous\nwhen inhaled. It is heavier than air and is easily condensed to a\nliquid. It dissolves in water, but this solution is not a mere physical\nsolution; the nitrogen peroxide is decomposed, forming a mixture of\nnitric and nitrous acids:",
  "2NO_{2} + H_{2}O = HNO_{2} + HNO_{3}.",
  "Nitrogen peroxide will not combine with more oxygen; it will, however,\ngive up a part of its oxygen to burning substances, acting as an\noxidizing agent:",
  "NO_{2} = NO + O.",
  "~Acid anhydrides.~ The oxides N_{2}O_{3} (nitrogen trioxide) and\nN_{2}O_{5} (nitrogen pentoxide) are rarely prepared and need not be\nseparately described. They bear a very interesting relation to the acids\nof nitrogen. When dissolved in water they combine with the water,\nforming acids:",
  "N_{2}O_{3} + H_{2}O = 2HNO_{2},",
  "N_{2}O_{5} + H_{2}O = 2HNO_{3}.",
  "On the other hand, nitrous acid very easily decomposes, yielding water\nand nitrogen trioxide, and by suitable means nitric acid likewise may be\ndecomposed into water and nitrogen pentoxide:",

  "REVERSIBLE REACTIONS AND CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM",
  "~Reversible reactions.~ The reactions so far considered have been\nrepresented as continuing, when once started, until one or the other\nsubstance taking part in the reaction has been used up. In some\nreactions this is not the case. For example, we have seen that when\nsteam is passed over hot iron the reaction is represented by the\nequation",
  "3Fe + 4H_{2}O = Fe_{3}O_{4} + 8H.",
  "On the other hand, when hydrogen is passed over hot iron oxide the\nreverse reaction takes place:",
  "Fe_{3}O_{4} +8H = 3Fe + 4H_{2}O.",
  "The reaction can therefore go in either direction, depending upon the\nconditions of the experiment. Such a reaction is called a _reversible\nreaction_. It is represented by an equation with double arrows in place\nof the equality sign, thus:",
  "3Fe + 4H_{2}O <--> Fe_{3}O_{4} + 8H.",
  "In a similar way, the equation",
  "N + 3H <--> NH_{3}",
  "expresses the fact that under some conditions nitrogen may unite with\nhydrogen to form ammonia, while under other conditions ammonia\ndecomposes into nitrogen and hydrogen.",
  "The conversion of oxygen into ozone is also reversible and may be\nrepresented thus:",
  "oxygen <--> ozone.",
  "~Chemical equilibrium.~ Reversible reactions do not usually go on to\ncompletion in one direction unless the conditions under which the\nreaction takes place are very carefully chosen. Thus, if iron and steam\nare confined in a heated tube, the steam acts upon the iron, producing\niron oxide and hydrogen. But these substances in turn act upon each\nother to form iron and steam once more. When these two opposite\nreactions go on at such rates that the weight of the iron changed into\niron oxide is just balanced by the weight of the iron oxide changed into\niron, there will be no further change in the relative weights of the\nfour substances present in the tube. The reaction is then said to have\nreached an equilibrium.",
  "~Factors which determine the point of equilibrium.~ There are two factors\nwhich have a great deal of influence in determining the point at which a\ngiven reaction will reach equilibrium.",
  "1. _Influence of the chemical nature of the substances._ If two\nreversible reactions of the same general kind are selected, it has been\nfound that the point of equilibrium is different in the two cases. For\nexample, in the reactions represented by the equations",
  "3Fe + 4H_{2}O <--> Fe_{3}O_{4} + 8H,",
  "Zn + H_{2}O <--> ZnO + 2H,",
  "the equilibrium will be reached when very different quantities of the\niron and zinc have been changed into oxides. The individual chemical\nproperties of the iron and zinc have therefore marked influence upon the\npoint at which equilibrium will be reached.",
  "2. _Influence of relative mass._ If the tube in which the reaction",
  "3Fe + 4H_{2}O <--> Fe_{3}O_{4} + 8H",
  "has come to an equilibrium is opened and more steam is admitted, an\nadditional quantity of the iron will be changed into iron oxide. If more\nhydrogen is admitted, some of the oxide will be reduced to metal. The\npoint of equilibrium is therefore dependent upon the relative masses of\nthe substances taking part in the reaction. When one of the substances\nis a solid, however, its mass has little influence, since it is only the\nextent of its surface which can affect the reaction.",
  "~Conditions under which reversible reactions are complete.~ If, when the\nequilibrium between iron and steam has been reached, the tube is opened\nand a current of steam is passed in, the hydrogen is swept away as fast\nas it is formed. The opposing reaction of hydrogen upon iron oxide must\ntherefore cease, and the action of steam on the iron will go on until\nall of the iron has been transformed into iron oxide.",
  "On the other hand, if a current of hydrogen is admitted into the tube,\nthe steam will be swept away by the hydrogen, and all of the iron oxide\nwill be reduced to iron. _A reversible reaction can therefore be\ncompleted in either direction when one of the products of the reaction\nis removed as fast as it is formed._",
  "~Equilibrium in solution.~ When reactions take place in solution in water\nthe same general principles hold good. The matter is not so simple,\nhowever, as in the case just described, owing to the fact that many of\nthe reactions in solution are due to the presence of ions. The\nsubstances most commonly employed in solution are acids, bases, or\nsalts, and all of these undergo dissociation. Any equilibrium which may\nbe reached in solutions of these substances must take place between the\nvarious ions formed, on the one hand, and the undissociated molecules,\non the other. Thus, when nitric acid is dissolved in water, equilibrium\nis reached in accordance with the equation",
  "H^{+} + NO_{3}^{-} <--> HNO_{3}.",
  "~Conditions under which reversible reactions in solution are complete.~\nThe equilibrium between substances in solution may be disturbed and the\nreaction caused to go on in one direction to completion in either of\nthree ways.",
  "1. _A gas may be formed which escapes from the solution._ When sodium\nnitrate and sulphuric acid are brought together in solution all four\nions, Na^{+}, NO_{3}^{-}, H^{+}, SO_{4}^{--}, are formed. These ions are\nfree to rearrange themselves in various combinations. For example, the\nH^{+} and the NO_{3}^{-} ions will reach the equilibrium",
  "H^{+} + NO_{3}^{-} <--> HNO_{3}.",
  "If the experiment is performed with very little water present, as is the\ncase in the preparation of nitric acid, the equilibrium will be reached\nwhen most of the H^{+} and the NO_{3}^{-} ions have combined to form\nundissociated HNO_{3}.",
  "Finally, if the mixture is now heated above the boiling point of nitric\nacid, the acid distills away as fast as it is formed. More and more\nH^{+} and NO_{3}^{-} ions will then combine, and the process will\ncontinue until one or the other of them has all been removed from the\nsolution. The substance remaining is sodium acid sulphate (NaHSO_{4}),\nand the reaction can therefore be expressed by the equation",
  "NaNO_{3} + H_{2}SO_{4} = NaHSO_{4} + HNO_{3}.",
  "2. _An insoluble solid may be formed._ When hydrochloric acid (HCl) and\nsilver nitrate (AgNO_{3}) are brought together in solution the\nfollowing ions will be present: H^{+}, Cl^{-}, Ag^{+}, NO_{3}^{-}. The\nions Ag^{+} and Cl^{-} will then set up the equilibrium",
  "Ag^{+} + Cl^{-} <--> AgCl.",
  "But silver chloride (AgCl) is almost completely insoluble in water, and\nas soon as a very little of it has formed the solution becomes\nsupersaturated, and the excess of the salt precipitates. More silver and\nchlorine ions then unite, and this continues until practically all of\nthe silver or the chlorine ions have been removed from the solution. We\nthen say that the following reaction is complete:",
  "AgNO_{3} + HCl = AgCl + HNO_{3}.",
  "3. _Two different ions may form undissociated molecules._ In the\nneutralization of sodium hydroxide by hydrochloric acid the ions H^{+}\nand OH^{-} come to the equilibrium",
  "H^{+} + OH^{-} <--> H_{2}O.",
  "But since water is almost entirely undissociated, equilibrium can only\nbe reached when there are very few hydroxyl or hydrogen ions present.\nConsequently the two ions keep uniting until one or the other of them is\npractically removed from the solution. When this occurs the\nneutralization expressed in the following equation is complete:",
  "NaOH + HCl = H_{2}O + NaCl.",
  "~Preparation of acids.~ The principle of reversible reactions finds\npractical application in the preparation of most of the common acids. An\nacid is usually prepared by treating the most common of its salts with\nsome other acid of high boiling point. The mixture is then heated until\nthe lower boiling acid desired distills out. Owing to its high boiling\npoint (338°), sulphuric acid is usually employed for this purpose, most\nother acids boiling below that temperature.",

  "CHAPTER XIV",
  "SULPHUR AND ITS COMPOUNDS",
  "~Occurrence.~ The element sulphur has been known from the earliest times,\nsince it is widely distributed in nature and occurs in large quantities\nin the uncombined form, especially in the neighborhood of volcanoes.\nSicily has long been famous for its sulphur mines, and smaller deposits\nare found in Italy, Iceland, Mexico, and especially in Louisiana, where\nit is mined extensively. In combination, sulphur occurs abundantly in\nthe form of sulphides and sulphates. In smaller amounts it is found in a\ngreat variety of minerals, and it is a constituent of many animal and\nvegetable substances.",
  "~Extraction of sulphur.~ Sulphur is prepared from the native substance,\nthe separation of crude sulphur from the rock and earthy materials with\nwhich it is mixed being a very simple process. The ore from the mines is\nmerely heated until the sulphur melts and drains away from the earthy\nimpurities. The crude sulphur obtained in this way is distilled in a\nretort-shaped vessel made of iron, the exit tube of which opens into a\ncooling chamber of brickwork. When the sulphur vapor first enters the\ncooling chamber it condenses as a fine crystalline powder called\n_flowers of sulphur_. As the condensing chamber becomes warm, the\nsulphur collects as a liquid in it, and is drawn off into cylindrical\nmolds, the product being called _roll sulphur_ or _brimstone_.",
  "~Physical properties.~ Roll sulphur is a pale yellow, crystalline solid,\nwithout marked taste and with but a faint odor. It is insoluble in\nwater, but is freely soluble in a few liquids, notably in carbon\ndisulphide. Roll sulphur melts at 114.8°. Just above the melting point\nit forms a rather thin, straw-colored liquid. As the temperature is\nraised, this liquid turns darker in color and becomes thicker, until at\nabout 235° it is almost black and is so thick that the vessel containing\nit can be inverted without danger of the liquid running out. At higher\ntemperatures it becomes thin once more, and boils at 448°, forming a\nyellowish vapor. On cooling the same changes take place in reverse\norder.",
  "~Varieties of sulphur.~ Sulphur is known in two general forms, crystalline\nand amorphous. Each of these forms exists in definite modifications.",
  "~Crystalline sulphur.~ Sulphur occurs in two crystalline forms, namely,\nrhombic sulphur and monoclinic sulphur.",
  "1. _Rhombic sulphur._ When sulphur crystallizes from its solution in\ncarbon disulphide it separates in crystals which have the same color and\nmelting point as roll sulphur, and are rhombic in shape. Roll sulphur is\nmade up of minute rhombic crystals.",
  "2. _Monoclinic sulphur._ When melted sulphur is allowed to cool until a\npart of the liquid has solidified, and the remaining liquid is then\npoured off, it is found that the solid sulphur remaining in the vessel\nhas assumed the form of fine needle-shaped crystals. These differ much\nin appearance from the rhombic crystals obtained by crystallizing\nsulphur from its solution in carbon disulphide. The needle-shaped form\nis called _monoclinic sulphur_. The two varieties differ also in density\nand in melting point, the monoclinic sulphur melting at 120°.",
  "Monoclinic and rhombic sulphur remain unchanged in contact with each\nother at 96°. Above this temperature the rhombic changes into\nmonoclinic; at lower temperatures the monoclinic changes into rhombic.\nThe temperature 96° is therefore called the transition point of sulphur.\nHeat is set free when monoclinic sulphur changes into rhombic.",
  "~Amorphous sulphur.~ Two varieties of amorphous sulphur can be readily\nobtained. These are white sulphur and plastic sulphur.",
  "1. _White sulphur._ Flowers of sulphur, the preparation of which has\nbeen described, consists of a mixture of rhombic crystals and amorphous\nparticles. When treated with carbon disulphide, the crystals dissolve,\nleaving the amorphous particles as a white residue.",
  "2. _Plastic sulphur._ When boiling sulphur is poured into cold water it\nassumes a gummy, doughlike form, which is quite elastic. This can be\nseen in a very striking manner by distilling sulphur from a small,\nshort-necked retort, such as is represented in Fig. 40, and allowing the\nliquid to run directly into water. In a few days it becomes quite\nbrittle and passes over into ordinary rhombic sulphur.",
  "[Illustration Fig. 40]",
  "~Chemical properties of sulphur.~ When sulphur is heated to its kindling\ntemperature in oxygen or in the air it burns with a pale blue flame,\nforming sulphur dioxide (SO_{2}). Small quantities of sulphur trioxide\n(SO_{3}) may also be formed in the combustion of sulphur. Most metals\nwhen heated with sulphur combine directly with it, forming metallic\nsulphides. In some cases the action is so energetic that the mass\nbecomes incandescent, as has been seen in the case of iron uniting with\nsulphur. This property recalls the action of oxygen upon metals, and in\ngeneral the metals which combine readily with oxygen are apt to combine\nquite readily with sulphur.",
  "~Uses of sulphur.~ Large quantities of sulphur are used as a germicide in\nvineyards, also in the manufacture of gunpowder, matches, vulcanized\nrubber, and sulphuric acid.",
  "COMPOUNDS OF SULPHUR WITH HYDROGEN",
  "~Hydrosulphuric acid~ (H_{2}S). This substance is a gas having the\ncomposition expressed by the formula H_{2}S and is commonly called\nhydrogen sulphide. It is found in the vapors issuing from volcanoes, and\nin solution in the so-called sulphur waters of many springs. It is\nformed when organic matter containing sulphur undergoes decay, just as\nammonia is formed under similar circumstances from nitrogenous matter.",
  "~Preparation.~ Hydrosulphuric acid is prepared in the laboratory by\ntreating a sulphide with an acid. Iron sulphide (FeS) is usually\nemployed:",
  "FeS + 2HCl = FeCl_{2} + H_{2}S.",
  "A convenient apparatus is shown in Fig. 41. A few lumps of iron sulphide\nare placed in the bottle A, and dilute acid is added in small\nquantities at a time through the funnel tube B, the gas escaping\nthrough the tube C.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 41]",
  "~Explanation of the reaction.~ Iron sulphide is a salt of\n     hydrosulphuric acid, and this reaction is therefore similar to\n     the one which takes place when sulphuric acid acts upon a\n     nitrate. In both cases a salt and an acid are brought together,\n     and there is a tendency for the reaction to go on until a state\n     of equilibrium is reached. This equilibrium is constantly\n     disturbed by the escape of the gaseous acid set free, so that\n     the reaction goes on until all of the original salt has been\n     decomposed. The two reactions differ in that the first one is\n     complete at ordinary temperatures, while in the case of\n     sulphuric acid acting upon sodium nitrate, the reacting\n     substances must be heated so as to secure a temperature at\n     which nitric acid is a gas.",
  "~Physical properties.~ Hydrosulphuric acid is a colorless gas, having a\nweak, disagreeable taste and an exceedingly offensive odor. It is rather\nsparingly soluble in water at ordinary temperatures, about three volumes\ndissolving in one of water. In boiling water it is not soluble at all.\nIn pure form it acts as a violent poison, and even when diluted largely\nwith air produces headache, dizziness, and nausea. It is a little\nheavier than air, having a density of 1.18.",
  "~Chemical properties.~ The most important chemical properties of\nhydrosulphuric acid are the following:",
  "1. _Acid properties._ Hydrosulphuric acid is a weak acid. In solution in\nwater it turns blue litmus red and neutralizes bases, forming salts\ncalled _sulphides_.",
  "2. _Action on oxygen._ The elements composing hydrosulphuric acid have\neach a strong affinity for oxygen, and are not held together very\nfirmly. Consequently the gas burns readily in oxygen or the air,\naccording to the equation",
  "H_{2}S + 3O = H_{2}O + SO_{2}.",
  "When there is not enough oxygen for both the sulphur and the hydrogen,\nthe latter element combines with the oxygen and the sulphur is set free:",
  "H_{2}S + O = H_{2}O + S.",
  "3. _Reducing action._ Owing to the ease with which hydrosulphuric acid\ndecomposes and the strong affinity of both sulphur and hydrogen for\noxygen, the substance is a strong reducing agent, taking oxygen away\nfrom many substances which contain it.",
  "4. _Action on metals._ Hydrosulphuric acid acts towards metals in a way\nvery similar to water. Thus, when it is passed over heated iron in a\ntube, the reaction is represented by the equation",
  "3Fe + 4H_{2}S = Fe_{3}S_{4} + 8H.",
  "Water in the form of steam, under similar circumstances, acts according\nto the equation",
  "3Fe + 4H_{2}O = Fe_{3}O_{4} + 8H.",
  "~Salts of hydrosulphuric acid,--sulphides.~ The salts of hydrosulphuric\nacid, called sulphides, form an important class of salts. Many of them\nare found abundantly in nature, and some of them are important ores.\nThey will be frequently mentioned in connection with the metals.",
  "Most of the sulphides are insoluble in water, and some of them are\ninsoluble in acids. Consequently, when hydrosulphuric acid is passed\ninto a solution of a salt, it often happens that a sulphide is\nprecipitated. With copper chloride the equation is",
  "CuCl_{2} + H_{2}S = CuS + 2HCl.",
  "Because of the fact that some metals are precipitated in this way as\nsulphides while others are not, hydrosulphuric acid is extensively used\nin the separation of the metals in the laboratory.",
  "~Explanation of the reaction.~ When hydrosulphuric acid and\n     copper chloride are brought together in solution, both copper\n     and sulphur ions are present, and these will come to an\n     equilibrium, as represented in the equation",
  "Cu^{+} + S^{-} <--> CuS.",
  "Since copper sulphide is almost insoluble in water, as soon as\n     a very small quantity has formed the solution becomes\n     supersaturated, and the excess keeps precipitating until nearly\n     all the copper or sulphur ions have been removed from the\n     solution. With some other ions, such as iron, the sulphide\n     formed does not saturate the solution, and no precipitate\n     results.",
  "OXIDES OF SULPHUR",
  "Sulphur forms two well-known compounds with oxygen: sulphur dioxide\n(SO_{2}), sometimes called sulphurous anhydride; and sulphur trioxide\n(SO_{3}), frequently called sulphuric anhydride.",
  "~Sulphur dioxide~ (SO_{2}). Sulphur dioxide occurs in nature in the gases\nissuing from volcanoes, and in solution in the water of many springs. It\nis likely to be found wherever sulphur compounds are undergoing\noxidation.",
  "~Preparation.~ Three general ways may be mentioned for the preparation of\nsulphur dioxide:",
  "1. _By the combustion of sulphur._ Sulphur dioxide is readily formed by\nthe combustion of sulphur in oxygen or the air:",
  "S + 2O = SO_{2}.",
  "It is also formed when substances containing sulphur are burned:",
  "ZnS + 3O = ZnO + SO_{2}.",
  "2. _By the reduction of sulphuric acid._ When concentrated sulphuric\nacid is heated with certain metals, such as copper, part of the acid is\nchanged into copper sulphate, and part is reduced to sulphurous acid.\nThe latter then decomposes into sulphur dioxide and water, the complete\nequation being",
  "Cu + 2H_{2}SO_{4} = CuSO_{4} + SO_{2} + 2H_{2}O.",
  "3. _By the action of an acid on a sulphite._ Sulphites are salts of\nsulphurous acid (H_{2}SO_{3}). When a sulphite is treated with an acid,\nsulphurous acid is set free, and being very unstable, decomposes into\nwater and sulphur dioxide. These reactions are expressed in the\nequations",
  "Na_{2}SO_{3} + 2HCl = 2NaCl + H_{2}SO_{3},",
  "H_{2}SO_{3} = H_{2}O + SO_{2}.",
  "~Explanation of the reaction.~ In this case we have two reversible\nreactions depending on each other. In the first reaction,",
  "(1) Na_{2}SO_{3} + 2HCl <--> 2NaCl + H_{2}SO_{3},",
  "we should expect an equilibrium to result, for none of the four\nsubstances in the equation are insoluble or volatile when water is\npresent to hold them in solution. But the quantity of the H_{2}SO_{3} is\nconstantly diminishing, owing to the fact that it decomposes, as\nrepresented in the equation",
  "(2) H_{2}SO_{3} <--> H_{2}O + SO_{2},",
  "and the sulphur dioxide, being a gas, escapes. No equilibrium can\ntherefore result, since the quantity of the sulphurous acid is\nconstantly being diminished because of the escape of sulphur dioxide.",
  "~Physical properties.~ Sulphur dioxide is a colorless gas, which at\nordinary temperatures is 2.2 times as heavy as air. It has a peculiar,\nirritating odor. The gas is very soluble in water, one volume of water\ndissolving eighty of the gas under standard conditions. It is easily\ncondensed to a colorless liquid, and can be purchased in this condition\nstored in strong bottles, such as the one represented in Fig. 42.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 42]",
  "~Chemical properties.~ Sulphur dioxide has a marked tendency to combine\nwith other substances, and is therefore an active substance chemically.\nIt combines with oxygen gas, but not very easily. It can, however, take\noxygen away from some other substances, and is therefore a good reducing\nagent. Its most marked chemical property is its ability to combine with\nwater to form sulphurous acid (H_{2}SO_{3}).",
  "~Sulphurous acid~ (H_{2}SO_{3}). When sulphur dioxide dissolves in water\nit combines chemically with it to form sulphurous acid, an unstable\nsubstance having the formula H_{3}SO_{3}. It is impossible to prepare\nthis acid in pure form, as it breaks down very easily into water and\nsulphur dioxide. The reaction is therefore reversible, and is expressed\nby the equation",
  "H_{2}O + SO_{2} <--> H_{2}SO_{3}.",
  "Solutions of the acid in water have a number of interesting properties.",
  "1. _Acid properties._ The solution has all the properties typical of an\nacid. When neutralized by bases, sulphurous acid yields a series of\nsalts called _sulphites_.",
  "2. _Reducing properties._ Solutions of sulphurous acid act as good\nreducing agents. This is due to the fact that sulphurous acid has the\npower of taking up oxygen from the air, or from substances rich in\noxygen, and is changed by this reaction into sulphuric acid:",
  "H_{2}SO_{3} + O = H_{2}SO_{4},",
  "H_{2}SO_{3} + H_{2}O_{2} = H_{2}S0_{4} + H_{2}O.",
  "3. _Bleaching properties._ Sulphurous acid has strong bleaching\nproperties, acting upon many colored substances in such a way as to\ndestroy their color. It is on this account used to bleach paper, straw\ngoods, and even such foods as canned corn.",
  "4. _Antiseptic properties._ Sulphurous acid has marked antiseptic\nproperties, and on this account has the power of arresting\nfermentation. It is therefore used as a preservative.",
  "~Salts of sulphurous acid,--sulphites.~ The sulphites, like sulphurous\nacid, have the power of taking up oxygen very readily, and are good\nreducing agents. On account of this tendency, commercial sulphites are\noften contaminated with sulphates. A great deal of sodium sulphite is\nused in the bleaching industry, and as a reagent for softening paper\npulp.",
  "~Sulphur trioxide~ (SO_{3}). When sulphur dioxide and oxygen are heated\ntogether at a rather high temperature, a small amount of sulphur\ntrioxide (SO_{3}) is formed, but the reaction is slow and incomplete.\nIf, however, the heating takes place in the presence of very fine\nplatinum dust, the reaction is rapid and nearly complete.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 43]",
  "~ Experimental preparation of sulphur trioxide.~ The experiment\n     can be performed by the use of the apparatus shown in Fig. 43,\n     the fine platinum being secured by moistening asbestos fiber\n     with a solution of platinum chloride and igniting it in a\n     flame. The fiber, covered with fine platinum, is placed in a\n     tube of hard glass, which is then heated with a burner to about\n     350°, while sulphur dioxide and air are passed into the tube.\n     Union takes place at once, and the strongly fuming sulphur\n     trioxide escapes from the jet at the end of the tube, and may\n     be condensed by surrounding the receiving tube with a freezing\n     mixture.",
  "~Properties of sulphur trioxide.~ Sulphur trioxide is a colorless liquid,\nwhich solidifies at about 15° and boils at 46°. A trace of moisture\ncauses it to solidify into a mass of silky white crystals, somewhat\nresembling asbestos fiber in appearance. In contact with the air it\nfumes strongly, and when thrown upon water it dissolves with a hissing\nsound and the liberation of a great deal of heat. The product of this\nreaction is sulphuric acid, so that sulphur trioxide is the anhydride of\nthat acid:",
  "SO_{3} + H_{2}O = H_{2}SO_{4}.",
  "~Catalysis.~ It has been found that many chemical reactions, such as the\nunion of sulphur dioxide with oxygen, are much influenced by the\npresence of substances which do not themselves seem to take a part in\nthe reaction, and are left apparently unchanged after it has ceased.\nThese reactions go on very slowly under ordinary circumstances, but are\ngreatly hastened by the presence of the foreign substance. Substances\nwhich hasten very slow reactions in this way are said to act as\ncatalytic agents or _catalyzers_, and the action is called _catalysis_.\nJust how the action is brought about is not well understood.",
  "DEFINITION: _A catalyzer is a substance which changes the velocity of a\nreaction, but does not change its products._",
  "~Examples of Catalysis.~ We have already had several instances of such\naction. Oxygen and hydrogen combine with each other at ordinary\ntemperatures in the presence of platinum powder, while if no catalytic\nagent is present they do not combine in appreciable quantities until a\nrather high temperature is reached. Potassium chlorate, when heated with\nmanganese dioxide, gives up its oxygen at a much lower temperature than\nwhen heated alone. Hydrogen dioxide decomposes very rapidly when\npowdered manganese dioxide is sifted into its concentrated solution.",
  "On the other hand, the catalytic agent sometimes retards chemical\naction. For example, a solution of hydrogen dioxide decomposes more\nslowly when it contains a little phosphoric acid than when perfectly\npure. For this reason commercial hydrogen dioxide always contains\nphosphoric acid.",
  "Many reactions are brought about by the catalytic action of traces of\nwater. For example, phosphorus will not burn in oxygen in the absence of\nall moisture. Hydrochloric acid will not unite with ammonia if the\nreagents are perfectly dry. It is probable that many of the chemical\ntransformations in physiological processes, such as digestion, are\nassisted by certain substances acting as catalytic agents. The principle\nof catalysis is therefore very important.",
  "~Sulphuric acid~ (_oil of vitriol_) (H_{2}SO_{4}). Sulphuric acid is one\nof the most important of all manufactured chemicals. Not only is it one\nof the most common reagents in the laboratory, but enormous quantities\nof it are used in many of the industries, especially in the refining of\npetroleum, the manufacture of nitroglycerin, sodium carbonate, and\nfertilizers.",
  "~Manufacture of sulphuric acid.~ 1. _Contact process_. The reactions\ntaking place in this process are represented by the following equations:",
  "SO_{2} + O = SO_{3},",
  "SO_{3} + H_{2}O = H_{2}SO_{4}.",
  "To bring about the first of these reactions rapidly, a catalyzer is\nemployed, and the process is carried out in the following way: Large\niron tubes are packed with some porous material, such as calcium and\nmagnesium sulphates, which contains a suitable catalytic substance\nscattered through it. The catalyzers most used are platinum powder,\nvanadium oxide, and iron oxide. Purified sulphur dioxide and air are\npassed through the tubes, which are kept at a temperature of about 350°.\nSulphur trioxide is formed, and as it issues from the tube it is\nabsorbed in water or dilute sulphuric acid. The process is continued\nuntil all the water in the absorbing vessel has been changed into\nsulphuric acid, so that a very concentrated acid is made in this way. An\nexcess of the trioxide may dissolve in the strong sulphuric acid,\nforming what is known as _fuming sulphuric acid_.",
  "2. _Chamber process._ The method of manufacture exclusively employed\nuntil recent years, and still in very extensive use, is much more\ncomplicated. The reactions are quite involved, but the conversion of\nwater, sulphur dioxide, and oxygen into sulphuric acid is accomplished\nby the catalytic action of oxides of nitrogen. The reactions are brought\nabout in large lead-lined chambers, into which oxides of nitrogen,\nsulphur dioxide, steam, and air are introduced in suitable proportions.",
  "~Reactions of the chamber process.~ In a very general way, the\n     various reactions which take place in the lead chambers may be\n     expressed in two equations. In the first reaction sulphur\n     dioxide, nitrogen peroxide, steam, and oxygen unite, as shown\n     in the equation",
  "(1) 2SO_{2} + 2NO_{2} + H_{2}O + O = 2SO_{2} (OH) (NO_{2}).",
  "The product formed in this reaction is called nitrosulphuric\n     acid or \"chamber crystals.\" It actually separates on the walls\n     of the chambers when the process is not working properly. Under\n     normal conditions, it is decomposed as fast as it is formed by\n     the action of excess of steam, as shown in the equation",
  "(2) 2SO_{2} (OH) (NO_{2}) + H_{2}O + O = 2H_{2}SO_{4} + 2NO_{2}.",
  "The nitrogen dioxide formed in this reaction can now enter into\n     combination with a new quantity of sulphur dioxide, steam, and\n     oxygen, and the series of reactions go on indefinitely. Many\n     other reactions occur, but these two illustrate the principle\n     of the process.",
  "The relation between sulphuric acid and nitrosulphuric acid can be seen\nby comparing their structural formulas:",
  "O=  -OH      O=  -OH\n       S            S\n    O=  -OH      O=  -NO_{2}",
  "The latter may be regarded as derived from the former by the\nsubstitution of the nitro group (NO_{2}) for the hydroxyl group (OH).",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 44]",
  "~The sulphuric acid plant.~ Fig. 44 illustrates the simpler parts of a\nplant used in the manufacture of sulphuric acid by the chamber process.\nSulphur or some sulphide, as FeS_{2}, is burned in furnace A. The\nresulting sulphur dioxide, together with air and some nitrogen peroxide,\nare conducted into the large chambers, the capacity of each chamber\nbeing about 75,000 cu. ft. Steam is also admitted into these chambers at\ndifferent points. These compounds react to form sulphuric acid,\naccording to the equations given above. The nitrogen left after the\nwithdrawal of the oxygen from the admitted air escapes through the\nGay-Lussac tower X. In order to prevent the escape of the oxides of\nnitrogen regenerated in the reaction, the tower is filled with lumps of\ncoke, over which trickles concentrated sulphuric acid admitted from Y.\nThe nitrogen peroxide dissolves in the acid and the resulting solution\ncollects in H. This is pumped into E, where it is mixed with dilute\nacid and allowed to trickle down through the chamber D (Glover tower),\nwhich is filled with some acid-resisting rock. Here the nitrogen\nperoxide is expelled from the solution by the action of the hot gases\nentering from A, and together with them enters the first chamber\nagain. The acid from which the nitrogen peroxide is expelled collects in\nF. Theoretically, a small amount of nitrogen peroxide would suffice to\nprepare an unlimited amount of sulphuric acid; practically, some of it\nescapes, and this is replaced by small amounts admitted at B.",
  "The sulphuric acid so formed, together with the excess of condensed\nsteam, collect upon the floor of the chambers in the form of a liquid\ncontaining from 62% to 70% of sulphuric acid. The product is called\n_chamber acid_ and is quite impure; but for many purposes, such as the\nmanufacture of fertilizers, it needs no further treatment. It can be\nconcentrated by boiling it in vessels made of iron or platinum, which\nresist the action of the acid, nearly all the water boiling off. Pure\nconcentrated acid can be made best by the contact process, while the\nchamber process is cheaper for the dilute impure acid.",
  "~Physical properties.~ Sulphuric acid is a colorless, oily liquid, nearly\ntwice as heavy as water. The ordinary concentrated acid contains about\n2% of water, has a density of 1.84, and boils at 338°. It is sometimes\ncalled _oil of vitriol_, since it was formerly made by distilling a\nsubstance called _green vitriol_.",
  "~Chemical properties.~ Sulphuric acid possesses chemical properties which\nmake it one of the most important of chemical substances.",
  "1. _Action as an acid._ In dilute solution sulphuric acid acts as any\nother acid, forming salts with oxides and hydroxides.",
  "2. _Action as an oxidizing agent._ Sulphuric acid contains a large\npercentage of oxygen and is, like nitric acid, a very good oxidizing\nagent. When the concentrated acid is heated with sulphur, carbon, and\nmany other substances, oxidation takes place, the sulphuric acid\ndecomposing according to the equation",
  "H_{2}SO_{4} = H_{2}SO_{3} + O.",
  "3. _Action on metals._ In dilute solution sulphuric acid acts upon many\nmetals, such as zinc, forming a sulphate and liberating hydrogen. When\nthe concentrated acid is employed the hydrogen set free is oxidized by a\nnew portion of the acid, with the liberation of sulphur dioxide. With\ncopper the reactions are expressed by the equations",
  "(1) Cu + H_{2}SO_{4} = CuSO_{4} + 2H,",
  "(2) H_{2}SO_{4} + 2H = H_{2}SO_{3} + H_{2}O,",
  "(3) H_{2}SO_{3} = H_{2}O + SO_{2}.",
  "By combining these equations the following one is obtained:",
  "Cu + 2H_{2}SO_{4} = CuSO_{4} + SO_{2} + 2H_{2}O.",
  "4. _Action on salts._ We have repeatedly seen that an acid of high\nboiling point heated with the salt of some acid of lower boiling point\nwill drive out the low boiling acid. The boiling point of sulphuric acid\n(338°) is higher than that of almost any common acid; hence it is used\nlargely in the preparation of other acids.",
  "5. _Action on water._ Concentrated sulphuric acid has a very great\naffinity for water, and is therefore an effective dehydrating agent.\nGases which have no chemical action upon sulphuric acid can be freed\nfrom water vapor by bubbling them through the strong acid. When the acid\nis diluted with water much heat is set free, and care must be taken to\nkeep the liquid thoroughly stirred during the mixing, and to pour the\nacid into the water,--never the reverse.",
  "Not only can sulphuric acid absorb water, but it will often withdraw the\nelements hydrogen and oxygen from a compound containing them,\ndecomposing the compound, and combining with the water so formed. For\nthis reason most organic substances, such as sugar, wood, cotton, and\nwoolen fiber, and even flesh, all of which contain much oxygen and\nhydrogen in addition to carbon, are charred or burned by the action of\nthe concentrated acid.",
  "~Salts of sulphuric acid,--sulphates.~ The sulphates form a very important\nclass of salts, and many of them have commercial uses. Copperas (iron\nsulphate), blue vitriol (copper sulphate), and Epsom salt (magnesium\nsulphate) serve as examples. Many sulphates are important minerals,\nprominent among these being gypsum (calcium sulphate) and barytes\n(barium sulphate).",
  "~Thiosulphuric acid~ (H_{2}S_{2}O_{3}); ~Thiosulphates.~ Many other\n     acids of sulphur containing oxygen are known, but none of them\n     are of great importance. Most of them cannot be prepared in a\n     pure state, and are known only through their salts. The most\n     important of these is thiosulphuric acid.",
  "When sodium sulphite is boiled with sulphur the two substances\n     combine, forming a salt which has the composition represented\n     in the formula Na_{2}S_{2}O_{3}:",
  "Na_{2}SO_{3} + S = Na_{2}S_{2}O_{3}.",
  "The substance is called sodium thiosulphate, and is a salt of\n     the easily decomposed acid H_{2}S_{2}O_{3}, called\n     thiosulphuric acid. This reaction is quite similar to the\n     action of oxygen upon sulphites:",
  "Na_{2}SO_{3} + O = Na_{2}SO_{4}.",
  "More commonly the salt is called sodium hyposulphite, or merely\n     \"hypo.\" It is a white solid and is extensively used in\n     photography, in the bleaching industry, and as a disinfectant.",
  "~Monobasic and dibasic acids.~ Such acids as hydrochloric and nitric\nacids, which have only one replaceable hydrogen atom in the molecule, or\nin other words yield one hydrogen ion in solution, are called monobasic\nacids. Acids yielding two hydrogen ions in solution are called dibasic\nacids. Similarly, we may have tribasic and tetrabasic acids. The three\nacids of sulphur are dibasic acids. It is therefore possible for each of\nthem to form both normal and acid salts. The acid salts can be made in\ntwo ways: the acid may be treated with only half enough base to\nneutralize it,--",
  "NaOH + H_{2}SO_{4} = NaHSO_{4} + H_{2}O;",
  "or a normal salt may be treated with the free acid,--",
  "Na_{2}SO_{4} + H_{2}SO_{4} = 2NaHSO_{4}.",
  "Acid sulphites and sulphides may be made in the same ways.",
  "~Carbon disulphide~ (CS_{2}). When sulphur vapor is passed over highly\nheated carbon the two elements combine, forming carbon disulphide\n(CS_{2}), just as oxygen and carbon unite to form carbon dioxide\n(CO_{2}). The substance is a heavy, colorless liquid, possessing, when\npure, a pleasant ethereal odor. On standing for some time, especially\nwhen exposed to sunlight, it undergoes a slight decomposition and\nacquires a most disagreeable, rancid odor. It has the property of\ndissolving many substances, such as gums, resins, and waxes, which are\ninsoluble in most liquids, and it is extensively used as a solvent for\nsuch substances. It is also used as an insecticide. It boils at a low\ntemperature (46°), and its vapor is very inflammable, burning in the air\nto form carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide, according to the equation",
  "CS_{2} + 6O = CO_{2} + 2SO_{2}.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 45]",
  "~Commercial preparation of carbon disulphide.~ In the preparation\n     of carbon disulphide an electrical furnace is employed, such as\n     is represented in Fig. 45. The furnace is packed with carbon\n     C, and this is fed in through the hoppers B, as fast as\n     that which is present in the hearth of the furnace is used up.\n     Sulphur is introduced at A, and at the lower ends of the\n     tubes it is melted by the heat of the furnace and flows into\n     the hearth as a liquid. An electrical current is passed through\n     the carbon and melted sulphur from the electrodes E, heating\n     the charge. The vapors of carbon disulphide pass up through the\n     furnace and escape at D, from which they pass to a suitable\n     condensing apparatus.",
  "~Comparison of sulphur and oxygen.~ A comparison of the formulas and the\nchemical properties of corresponding compounds of oxygen and sulphur\nbrings to light many striking similarities. The conduct of\nhydrosulphuric acid and water toward many substances has been seen to be\nvery similar; the oxides and sulphides of the metals have analogous\nformulas and undergo many parallel reactions. Carbon dioxide and\ndisulphide are prepared in similar ways and undergo many analogous\nreactions. It is clear, therefore, that these two elements are far more\nclosely related to each other than to any of the other elements so far\nstudied.",
  "~Selenium and tellurium.~ These two very uncommon elements are still more\nclosely related to sulphur than is oxygen. They occur in comparatively\nsmall quantities and are usually found associated with sulphur and\nsulphides, either as the free elements or more commonly in combination\nwith metals. They form compounds with hydrogen of the formulas H_{2}Se\nand H_{2}Te; these bodies are gases with properties very similar to\nthose of H_{2}S. They also form oxides and oxygen acids which resemble\nthe corresponding sulphur compounds. The elements even have allotropic\nforms corresponding very closely to those of sulphur. Tellurium is\nsometimes found in combination with gold and copper, and occasions some\ndifficulties in the refining of these metals. The elements have very few\npractical applications.",
  "~Crystallography.~ In order to understand the difference between the two\nkinds of sulphur crystals, it is necessary to know something about\ncrystals in general and the forms which they may assume. An examination\nof a large number of crystals has shown that although they may differ\nmuch in geometric form, they can all be considered as modifications of a\nfew simple plans. The best way to understand the relation of one crystal\nto another is to look upon every crystal as having its faces and angles\narranged in definite fashion about certain imaginary lines drawn\nthrough the crystal. These lines are called axes, and bear much the same\nrelation to a crystal as do the axis and parallels of latitude and\nlongitude to the earth and a geographical study of it. All crystals can\nbe referred to one of six simple plans or systems, which have their axes\nas shown in the following drawings.",
  "The names and characteristics of these systems are as follows:",
  "1. Isometric or regular system (Fig. 46). Three equal axes, all at right\nangles.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 46]",
  "2. Tetragonal system (Fig. 47). Two equal axes and one of different\nlength, all at right angles to each other.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 47]",
  "3. Orthorhombic system (Fig. 48). Three unequal axes, all at right\nangles to each other.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 48]",
  "4. Monoclinic system (Fig. 49). Two axes at right angles, and a third at\nright angles to one of these, but inclined to the other.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 49]",
  "5. Triclinic system (Fig. 50). Three axes, all inclined to each other.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 50]",
  "6. Hexagonal system (Fig. 51). Three equal axes in the same plane\nintersecting at angles of 60°, and a fourth at right angles to all of\nthese.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 51]",
  "Every crystal can be imagined to have its faces and angles arranged in a\ndefinite way around one of these systems of axes. A cube, for instance,\nis referred to Plan 1, an axis ending in the center of each face; while\nin a regular octohedron an axis ends in each solid angle. These forms\nare shown in Fig. 46. It will be seen that both of these figures belong\nto the same system, though they are very different in appearance. In the\nsame way, many geometric forms may be derived from each of the systems,\nand the light lines about the axes in the drawings show two of the\nsimplest forms of each of the systems.",
  "In general a given substance always crystallizes in the same system, and\ntwo corresponding faces of each crystal of it always make the same angle\nwith each other. A few substances, of which sulphur is an example,\ncrystallize in two different systems, and the crystals differ in such\nphysical properties as melting point and density. Such substances are\nsaid to be _dimorphous_.",

  "PERIODIC LAW",
  "A number of the elements have now been studied somewhat closely. The\nfirst three of these, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, while having some\nphysical properties in common with each other, have almost no point of\nsimilarity as regards their chemical conduct. On the other hand, oxygen\nand sulphur, while quite different physically, have much in common in\ntheir chemical properties.",
  "About eighty elements are now known. If all of these should have\nproperties as diverse as do oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, the study of\nchemistry would plainly be a very difficult and complicated one. If,\nhowever, the elements can be classified in groups, the members of which\nhave very similar properties, the study will be very much simplified.",
  "~Earlier classification of the elements.~ Even at an early period efforts\nwere made to discover some natural principle in accordance with which\nthe elements could be classified. Two of these classifications may be\nmentioned here.",
  "1. _Classification into metals and non-metals._ The classification into\nmetals and non-metals most naturally suggested itself. This grouping was\nbased largely on physical properties, the metals being heavy, lustrous,\nmalleable, ductile, and good conductors of heat and electricity.\nElements possessing these properties are usually base-forming in\ncharacter, and the ability to form bases came to be regarded as a\ncharacteristic property of the metals. The non-metals possessed\nphysical properties which were the reverse of those of the metals, and\nwere acid-forming in character.",
  "Not much was gained by this classification, and it was very imperfect.\nSome metals, such as potassium, are very light; some non-metals, such as\niodine, have a high luster; some elements can form either an acid or a\nbase.",
  "2. _Classification into triad families._ In 1825 Döbereiner observed\nthat an interesting relation exists between the atomic weights of\nchemically similar elements. To illustrate, lithium, sodium, and\npotassium resemble each other very closely, and the atomic weight of\nsodium is almost exactly an arithmetical mean between those of the other\ntwo: (7.03 + 39.15)/2 = 23.09. In many chemical and physical properties\nsodium is midway between the other two.",
  "A number of triad families were found, but among eighty elements, whose\natomic weights range all the way from 1 to 240, such agreements might be\nmere chance. Moreover many elements did not appear to belong to such\nfamilies.",
  "~Periodic division.~ In 1869 the Russian chemist Mendeléeff devised an\narrangement of the elements based on their atomic weights, which has\nproved to be of great service in the comparative study of the elements.\nA few months later the German, Lothar Meyer, independently suggested the\nsame ideas. This arrangement brought to light a great generalization,\nnow known as the _periodic law_. An exact statement of the law will be\ngiven after the method of arranging the elements has been described.",
  "[Illustration: DMITRI IVANOVITCH MENDELÉEFF (Russian) (1834-1907)",
  "Author of the periodic law; made many investigations on the physical\nconstants of elements and compounds; wrote an important book entitled\n\"Principles of Chemistry\"; university professor and government\nofficial]",
  "~Arrangement of the periodic table.~ The arrangement suggested by\nMendeléeff, modified somewhat by more recent investigations, is as\nfollows: Beginning with lithium, which has an atomic weight of 7, the\nelements are arranged in a horizontal row in the order of their atomic\nweights, thus:",
  "~Li (7.03), Be (9.1), B (11), C (12), N (14.04), O (16), F (19).~",
  "These seven elements all differ markedly from each other. The eighth\nelement, sodium, is very similar to lithium. It is placed just under\nlithium, and a new row follows:",
  "~Na(23.05), Mg (24.36), Al (27.1), Si (28.4), P (31), S (32.06),\nCl(35.45).~",
  "When the fifteenth element, potassium, is reached, it is placed under\nsodium, to which it is very similar, and serves to begin a third row:",
  "~K (39.15), Ca (40.1), Sc (44.1,) Ti (48.1), V (51.2), Cr (52.1), Mn(55).~",
  "Not only is there a strong similarity between lithium, sodium, and\npotassium, which have been placed in a vertical row because of this\nresemblance, but the elements in the other vertical rows exhibit much of\nthe same kind of similarity among themselves, and evidently form little\nnatural groups.",
  "The three elements following manganese, namely, iron, nickel, and\ncobalt, have atomic weights near together, and are very similar\nchemically. They do not strongly resemble any of the elements so far\nconsidered, and are accordingly placed in a group by themselves,\nfollowing manganese. A new row is begun with copper, which somewhat\nresembles the elements of the first vertical column.

  "[* This includes a number of elements whose atomic weights lie\nbetween 140 and 173, but which have not been accurately studied, and\nso their proper arrangement is uncertain.]",
  "~Place of the atmospheric elements.~ When argon was discovered it was seen\nat once that there was no place in the table for an element of atomic\nweight approximately 40. When the other inactive elements were found,\nhowever, it became apparent that they form a group just preceding Group\n1. They are accordingly arranged in this way in Group 0 (see table on\nopposite page). A study of this table brings to light certain very\nstriking facts.",
  "~Properties of elements vary with atomic weights.~ There is evidently a\nclose relation between the properties of an element and its atomic\nweight. Lithium, at the beginning of the first group, is a very strong\nbase-forming element, with pronounced metallic properties. Beryllium,\nfollowing lithium, is less strongly base-forming, while boron has some\nbase-forming and some acid-forming properties. In carbon all\nbase-forming properties have disappeared, and the acid-forming\nproperties are more marked than in boron. These become still more\nemphasized as we pass through nitrogen and oxygen, until on reaching\nfluorine we have one of the strongest acid-forming elements. The\nproperties of these seven elements therefore vary regularly with their\natomic weights, or, in mathematical language, are regular functions of\nthem.",
  "~Periodic law.~ The properties of the first seven elements vary\n_continuously_--that is steadily--away from base-forming and toward\nacid-forming properties. If lithium had the smallest atomic weight of\nany of the elements, and fluorine the greatest, so that in passing from\none to the other we had included all the elements, we could say that the\nproperties of elements are continuous functions of their atomic weights.\nBut fluorine is an element of small atomic weight, and the one following\nit, sodium, breaks the regular order, for in it reappear all the\ncharacteristic properties of lithium. Magnesium, following sodium, bears\nmuch the same relation to beryllium that sodium does to lithium, and\nthe properties of the elements in the second row vary much as they do in\nthe first row until potassium is reached, when another repetition\nbegins. The properties of the elements do not vary continuously,\ntherefore, with atomic weights, but at regular intervals there is a\nrepetition, or _period_. This generalization is known as the _periodic\nlaw_, and may be stated thus: _The properties of elements are periodic\nfunctions of their atomic weights._",
  "~The two families in a group.~ While all the elements in a given vertical\ncolumn bear a general resemblance to each other, it has been noticed\nthat those belonging to periods having even numbers are very strikingly\nsimilar to each other. They are placed at the left side of the group\ncolumns. In like manner, the elements belonging to the odd periods are\nvery similar and are arranged at the right side of the group columns.\nThus calcium, strontium, and barium are very much alike; so, too, are\nmagnesium, zinc, and cadmium. The resemblance between calcium and\nmagnesium, or strontium and zinc, is much less marked. This method of\narrangement therefore divides each group into two families, each\ncontaining four or five members, between which there is a great\nsimilarity.",
  "~Family resemblances.~ Let us now inquire more closely in what respects\nthe elements of a family resemble each other.",
  "1. _Valence._ In general the valence of the elements in a family is the\nsame, and the formulas of their compounds are therefore similar. If we\nknow that the formula of sodium chloride is NaCl, it is pretty certain\nthat the formula of potassium chloride will be KCl--not KCl_{2} or\nKCl_{3}. The general formulas R_{2}O, RO, etc., placed below the\ncolumns show the formulas of the oxides of the elements in the column\nprovided they form oxides. In like manner the formulas RH, RH_{2}, etc.,\nshow the composition of the compounds formed with hydrogen or chlorine.",
  "2. _Chemical properties._ The chemical properties of the members of a\nfamily are quite similar. If one member is a metal, the others usually\nare; if one is a non-metal, so, too, are the others. The families in the\nfirst two columns consist of metals, while the elements found in the\nlast two columns form acids. There is in addition a certain regularity\nin properties of the elements in each family. If the element at the head\nof the family is a strong acid-forming element, this property is likely\nto diminish gradually, as we pass to the members of the family with\nhigher atomic weights. Thus phosphorus is strongly acid-forming, arsenic\nless so, antimony still less so, while bismuth has almost no\nacid-forming properties. We shall meet with many illustrations of this\nfact.",
  "3. _Physical properties._ In the same way, the physical properties of\nthe members of a family are in general somewhat similar, and show a\nregular gradation as we pass from element to element in the family. Thus\nthe densities of the members of the magnesium family are",
  "Mg = 1.75, Zn = 7.00, Cd = 8.67, Hg = 13.6.",
  "Their melting points are",
  "Mg = 750°, Zn = 420°, Cd = 320°, Hg = -39.5°.",
  "~Value of the periodic law.~ The periodic law has proved of much value in\nthe development of the science of chemistry.",
  "1. _It simplifies study._ It is at once evident that such regularities\nvery much simplify the study of chemistry. A thorough study of one\nelement of a family makes the study of the other members a much easier\ntask, since so many of the properties and chemical reactions of the\nelements are similar. Thus, having studied the element sulphur in some\ndetail, it is not necessary to study selenium and tellurium so closely,\nfor most of their properties can be predicted from the relation which\nthey sustain to sulphur.",
  "2. _It predicts new elements._ When the periodic law was first\nformulated there were a number of vacant places in the table which\nevidently belonged to elements at that time unknown. From their position\nin the table, Mendeléeff predicted with great precision the properties\nof the elements which he felt sure would one day be discovered to fill\nthese places. Three of them, scandium, germanium, and gallium, were\nfound within fifteen years, and their properties agreed in a remarkable\nway with the predictions of Mendeléeff. There are still some vacant\nplaces in the table, especially among the heavier elements.",
  "3. _It corrects errors._ The physical constants of many of the elements\ndid not at first agree with those demanded by the periodic law, and a\nfurther study of many such cases showed that errors had been made. The\nlaw has therefore done much service in indicating probable error.",
  "~Imperfections of the law.~ There still remain a good many features which\nmust be regarded as imperfections in the law. Most conspicuous is the\nfact that the element hydrogen has no place in the table. In some of the\ngroups elements appear in one of the families, while all of their\nproperties show that they belong in the other. Thus sodium belongs with\nlithium and not with copper; fluorine belongs with chlorine and not with\nmanganese. There are two instances where the elements must be\ntransposed in order to make them fit into their proper group. According\nto their atomic weights, tellurium should follow iodine, and argon\nshould follow potassium. Their properties show in each case that this\norder must be reversed. The table separates some elements altogether\nwhich, in many respects have closely agreeing properties. Iron,\nchromium, and manganese are all in different groups, although they are\nsimilar in many respects.",
  "The system is therefore to be regarded as but a partial and imperfect\nexpression of some very important and fundamental relation between the\nsubstances which we know as elements, the exact nature of this relation\nbeing as yet not completely clear to us.",
  "EXERCISES",
  "1. Suppose that an element were discovered that filled the blank in\nGroup O, Period 5; what properties would it probably have?",
  "2. Suppose that an element were discovered that filled the blank in\nGroup VI, Period 9, family B; what properties would it have?",
  "3. Sulphur and oxygen both belong in Group VI, although in different\nfamilies; in what respects are the two similar?",

  "~The family.~ The four elements named in the above table form a strongly\nmarked family of elements and illustrate very clearly the way in which\nthe members of a family in a periodic group resemble each other, as well\nas the character of the differences which we may expect to find between\nthe individual members.",
  "1. _Occurrence._ These elements do not occur in nature in the free\nstate. The compounds of the last three elements of the family are found\nextensively in sea water, and on this account the name _halogens_,\nsignifying \"producers of sea salt,\" is sometimes applied to the family.",
  "2. _Properties._ As will be seen by reference to the table, the melting\npoints and boiling points of the elements of the family increase with\ntheir atomic weights. A somewhat similar gradation is noted in their\ncolor and state. One atom of each of the elements combines with one atom\nof hydrogen to form acids, which are gases very soluble in water. The\naffinity of the elements for hydrogen is in the inverse order of their\natomic weights, fluorine having the strongest affinity and iodine the\nweakest. Only chlorine and iodine form oxides, and those of the former\nelement are very unstable. The elements of the group are univalent in\ntheir compounds with hydrogen and the metals.",
  "FLUORINE",
  "~Occurrence.~ The element fluorine occurs in nature most abundantly as the\nmineral fluorspar (CaF_{2}), as cryolite (Na_{3}AlF_{6}), and in the\ncomplex mineral apatite (3 Ca_{3}(PO_{4})_{2}·CaF_{2}).",
  "~Preparation.~ All attempts to isolate the element resulted in failure\nuntil recent years. Methods similar to those which succeed in the\npreparation of the other elements of the family cannot be used; for as\nsoon as the fluorine is liberated it combines with the materials of\nwhich the apparatus is made or with the hydrogen of the water which is\nalways present. The preparation of fluorine was finally accomplished by\nthe French chemist Moissan by the electrolysis of hydrofluoric acid.\nPerfectly dry hydrofluoric acid (HF) was condensed to a liquid and\nplaced in a U-shaped tube made of platinum (or copper), which was\nfurnished with electrodes and delivery tubes, as shown in Fig. 52. This\nliquid is not an electrolyte, but becomes such when potassium fluoride\nis dissolved in it. When this solution was electrolyzed hydrogen was set\nfree at the cathode and fluorine at the anode.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 52]",
  "~Properties.~ Fluorine is a gas of slightly yellowish color, and can be\ncondensed to a liquid boiling at -187° under atmospheric pressure. It\nsolidifies at -223°. It is extremely active chemically, being the most\nactive of all the elements at ordinary temperatures.",
  "It combines with all the common elements save oxygen, very often with\nincandescence and the liberation of much heat. It has a strong affinity\nfor hydrogen and is able to withdraw it from its compounds with other\nelements. Because of its great activity it is extremely poisonous.\nFluorine does not form any oxides, neither does it form any oxygen\nacids, in which respects it differs from the other members of the\nfamily.",
  "~Hydrofluoric acid~ (HF). Hydrofluoric acid is readily obtained from\nfluorspar by the action of concentrated sulphuric acid. The equation is",
  "CaF_{2} + H_{2}SO_{4} = CaSO_{4} + 2HF.",
  "In its physical properties it resembles the binary acids of the other\nelements of this family, being, however, more easily condensed to a\nliquid. The anhydrous acid boils at 19° and can therefore be prepared at\nordinary pressures. It is soluble in all proportions in water, and a\nconcentrated solution--about 50%--is prepared for the market. Its fumes\nare exceedingly irritating to the respiratory organs, and several\nchemists have lost their lives by accidentally breathing them.",
  "[Illustration: HENRI MOISSAN (French) (1853-1907)",
  "Famous for his work with the electric furnace at high temperatures;\nprepared artificial diamonds, together with many new binary compounds\nsuch as carbides, silicides, borides, and nitrides; isolated fluorine\nand studied its properties and its compounds very thoroughly]",
  "~Chemical properties.~ Hydrofluoric acid, like other strong acids, readily\nacts on bases and metallic oxides and forms the corresponding fluorides.\nIt also dissolves certain metals such as silver and copper. It acts very\nvigorously upon organic matter, a single drop of the concentrated acid\nmaking a sore on the skin which is very painful and slow in healing. Its\nmost characteristic property is its action upon silicon dioxide\n(SiO_{2}), with which it forms water and the gas silicon tetrafluoride\n(SiF_{4}), as shown in the equation",
  "SiO_{2} + 4HF = SiF_{4} + 2H_{2}O.",
  "Glass consists of certain compounds of silicon, which are likewise acted\non by the acid so that it cannot be kept in glass bottles. It is\npreserved in flasks made of wax or gutta-percha.",
  "~Etching.~ Advantage is taken of this reaction in etching designs\n     upon glass. The glass vessel is painted over with a protective\n     paint upon which the acid will not act, the parts which it is\n     desired to make opaque being left unprotected. A mixture of\n     fluorspar and sulphuric acid is then painted over the vessel\n     and after a few minutes the vessel is washed clean. Wherever\n     the hydrofluoric acid comes in contact with the glass it acts\n     upon it, destroying its luster and making it opaque, so that\n     the exposed design will be etched upon the clear glass. Frosted\n     glass globes are often made in this way.",
  "The etching may also be effected by covering the glass with a\n     thin layer of paraffin, cutting the design through the wax and\n     then exposing the glass to the fumes of the acid.",
  "~Salts of hydrofluoric acid,--fluorides.~ A number of the fluorides are\nknown, but only one of them, calcium fluoride (CaF_{2}), is of\nimportance. This is the well-known mineral fluorspar.",
  "CHLORINE",
  "~Historical.~ While studying the action of hydrochloric acid upon the\nmineral pyrolusite, in 1774, Scheele obtained a yellowish, gaseous\nsubstance to which he gave a name in keeping with the phlogiston theory\nthen current. Later it was supposed to be a compound containing oxygen.\nIn 1810, however, the English chemist Sir Humphry Davy proved it to be\nan element and named it chlorine.",
  "~Occurrence.~ Chlorine does not occur free in nature, but its compounds\nare widely distributed. For the most part it occurs in combination with\nthe metals in the form of chlorides, those of sodium, potassium, and\nmagnesium being most abundant. Nearly all salt water contains these\nsubstances, particularly sodium chloride, and very large salt beds\nconsisting of chlorides are found in many parts of the world.",
  "~Preparation.~ Two general methods of preparing chlorine may be mentioned,\nnamely, the laboratory method and the electrolytic method.",
  "1. _Laboratory method._ In the laboratory chlorine is made by warming\nthe mineral pyrolusite (manganese dioxide, MnO_{2}) with concentrated\nhydrochloric acid. The first reaction, which seems to be similar to the\naction of acids upon oxides in general, is expressed in the equation",
  "MnO_{2} + 4HCl = MnCl_{4} + 2H_{2}O.",
  "The manganese compound so formed is very unstable, however, and breaks\nclown according to the equation",
  "MnCl_{4} = MnCl_{2} + 2Cl.",
  "Instead of using hydrochloric acid in the preparation of chlorine it\nwill serve just as well to use a mixture of sodium chloride and\nsulphuric acid, since these two react to form hydrochloric acid. The\nfollowing equations will then express the changes:",
  "(1) 2NaCl + H_{2}SO_{4} = Na_{2}SO_{4} + 2HCl.",
  "(2) MnO_{2} + 4 HCl = MnCl_{2} + 2Cl + 2H_{2}O.",
  "(3) MnCl_{2} + H_{2}SO_{4} = MnSO_{4} + 2HCl.",
  "Combining these equations, the following equation expressing the\ncomplete reaction is obtained:",
  "2NaCl + MnO_{2} + 2H_{2}SO_{4} = MnSO_{4} + Na_{2}SO_{4} + 2H_{2}O + 2Cl.",
  "Since the hydrochloric acid liberated in the third equation is free to\nact upon manganese dioxide, it will be seen that all of the chlorine\noriginally present in the sodium chloride is set free.",
  "The manganese dioxide and the hydrochloric acid are brought\n     together in a flask, as represented in Fig. 53, and a gentle\n     heat is applied. The rate of evolution of the gas is regulated\n     by the amount of heat applied, and the gas is collected by\n     displacement of air. As the equations show, only half of the\n     chlorine present in the hydrochloric acid is liberated.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 53]",
  "2. _Electrolytic method._ Under the discussion of electrolysis (p. 102)\nit was shown that when a solution of sodium chloride is electrolyzed\nchlorine is evolved at the anode, while the sodium set free at the\ncathode reacts with the water to form hydrogen, which is evolved, and\nsodium hydroxide, which remains in solution. A great deal of the\nchlorine required in the chemical industries is now made in this way in\nconnection with the manufacture of sodium hydroxide.",
  "~Physical properties.~ Chlorine is a greenish-yellow gas, which has a\npeculiar suffocating odor and produces a very violent effect upon the\nthroat and lungs. Even when inhaled in small quantities it often\nproduces all the symptoms of a hard cold, and in larger quantities may\nhave serious and even fatal action. It is quite heavy (density = 2.45)\nand can therefore be collected by displacement of air. One volume of\nwater under ordinary conditions dissolves about three volumes of\nchlorine. The gas is readily liquefied, a pressure of six atmospheres\nserving to liquefy it at 0°. It forms a yellowish liquid which\nsolidifies at -102°.",
  "~Chemical properties.~ At ordinary temperatures chlorine is far more\nactive chemically than any of the elements we have so far considered,\nwith the exception of fluorine; indeed, it is one of the most active of\nall elements.",
  "1. _Action on metals._ A great many metals combine directly with\nchlorine, especially when hot. A strip of copper foil heated in a burner\nflame and then dropped into chlorine burns with incandescence. Sodium\nburns brilliantly when heated strongly in slightly moist chlorine. Gold\nand silver are quickly tarnished by the gas.",
  "2. _Action on non-metals._ Chlorine has likewise a strong affinity for\nmany of the non-metals. Thus phosphorus burns in a current of the gas,\nwhile antimony and arsenic in the form of a fine powder at once burst\ninto flame when dropped into jars of the gas. The products formed in all\ncases where chlorine combines with another element are called\n_chlorides_.",
  "3. _Action on hydrogen._ Chlorine has a strong affinity for hydrogen,\nuniting with it to form hydrochloric acid. A jet of hydrogen burning in\nthe air continues to burn when introduced into a jar of chlorine, giving\na somewhat luminous flame. A mixture of the two gases explodes violently\nwhen a spark is passed through it or when it is exposed to bright\nsunlight. In the latter case it is the light and not the heat which\nstarts the action.",
  "4. _Action on substances containing hydrogen._ Not only will chlorine\ncombine directly with free hydrogen but it will often abstract the\nelement from its compounds. Thus, when chlorine is passed into a\nsolution containing hydrosulphuric acid, sulphur is precipitated and\nHydrochloric acid formed. The reaction is shown by the following\nequation:",
  "H_{2}S + 2Cl = 2HCl + S.",
  "With ammonia the action is similar:",
  "NH_{3} + 3Cl = 3HCl + N.",
  "The same tendency is very strikingly seen in the action of chlorine upon\nturpentine. The latter substance is largely made up of compounds having\nthe composition represented by the formula C_{10}H_{16}. When a strip of\npaper moistened with warm turpentine is placed in a jar of chlorine\ndense fumes of hydrochloric acid appear and a black deposit of carbon is\nformed. Even water, which is a very stable compound, can be decomposed\nby chlorine, the oxygen being liberated. This may be shown in the\nfollowing way:",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 54]",
  "If a long tube of rather large diameter is filled with a strong\n     solution of chlorine in water and inverted in a vessel of the\n     same solution, as shown in Fig. 54, and the apparatus is placed\n     in bright sunlight, very soon bubbles of a gas will be observed\n     to rise through the solution and collect in the tube. An\n     examination of this gas will show that it is oxygen. It is\n     liberated from water in accordance with the following equation:",
  "H_{2}O + 2Cl = 2HCl + O.",
  "5. _Action on color substances,--bleaching action._ If strips of\nbrightly colored cloth or some highly colored flowers are placed in\nquite dry chlorine, no marked change in color is noticed as a rule. If,\nhowever, the cloth and flowers are first moistened, the color rapidly\ndisappears, that is, the objects are bleached. Evidently the moisture as\nwell as the chlorine is concerned in the action, and a study of the case\nshows that the chlorine has combined with the hydrogen of the water. The\noxygen set free oxidizes the color substance, converting it into a\ncolorless compound. It is evident from this explanation that chlorine\nwill only bleach those substances which are changed into colorless\ncompounds by oxidation.",
  "6. _Action as a disinfectant._ Chlorine has also marked germicidal\nproperties, and the free element, as well as compounds from which it is\neasily liberated, are used as disinfectants.",
  "~Nascent state.~ It will be noticed that oxygen when set free from water\nby chlorine is able to do what ordinary oxygen cannot do, for both the\ncloth and the flowers are unchanged in the air which contains oxygen. It\nis generally true that the activity of an element is greatest at the\ninstant of liberation from its compounds. To express this fact elements\nat the instant of liberation are said to be in the _nascent state_. It\nis nascent oxygen which does the bleaching.",
  "~Hydrochloric acid~ (_muriatic acid_) (HCl). The preparation of\nhydrochloric acid may be discussed under two general heads:",
  "1. _Laboratory preparation._ The product formed by the burning of\nhydrogen in chlorine is the gas hydrochloric acid. This substance is\nmuch more easily obtained, however, by treating common salt (sodium\nchloride) with sulphuric acid. The following equation shows the\nreaction:",
  "2NaCl + H_{2}SO_{4} = Na_{2}SO_{4} + 2HCl.",
  "The dry salt is placed in a flask furnished with a funnel tube and an\nexit tube, the sulphuric acid is added, and the flask gently warmed. The\nhydrochloric acid gas is rapidly given off and can be collected by\ndisplacement of air. The same apparatus can be used as was employed in\nthe preparation of chlorine (Fig. 53).",
  "When a _solution_ of salt is treated with sulphuric acid there\n     is no very marked action. The hydrochloric acid formed is very\n     soluble in water, and so does not escape from the solution;\n     hence a state of equilibrium is soon reached between the four\n     substances represented in the equation. When _concentrated_\n     sulphuric acid, in which hydrochloric acid is not soluble, is\n     poured upon dry salt the reaction is complete.",
  "2. _Commercial preparation._ Commercially, hydrochloric acid is prepared\nin connection with the manufacture of sodium sulphate, the reaction\nbeing the same as that just given. The reaction is carried out in a\nfurnace, and the hydrochloric acid as it escapes in the form of gas is\npassed into water in which it dissolves, the solution forming the\nhydrochloric acid of commerce. When the materials are pure a colorless\nsolution is obtained. The most concentrated solution has a density of\n1.2 and contains 40% HCl. The commercial acid, often called _muriatic\nacid_, is usually colored yellow by impurities.",
  "~Composition of hydrochloric acid.~ When a solution of hydrochloric acid\nis electrolyzed in an apparatus similar to the one in which water was\nelectrolyzed (Fig. 18), chlorine collects at the anode and hydrogen at\nthe cathode. At first the chlorine dissolves in the water, but soon the\nwater in the one tube becomes saturated with it, and if the stopcocks\nare left open until this is the case, and are then closed, it will be\nseen that the two gases are set free in equal volumes.",
  "When measured volumes of the two gases are caused to unite it is found\nthat one volume of hydrogen combines with one of chlorine. Other\nexperiments show that the volume of hydrochloric acid formed is just\nequal to the sum of the volumes of hydrogen and chlorine. Therefore one\nvolume of hydrogen combines with one volume of chlorine to form two\nvolumes of hydrochloric acid gas. Since chlorine is 35.18 times as heavy\nas hydrogen, it follows that one part of hydrogen by weight combines\nwith 35.18 parts of chlorine to form 36.18 parts of hydrochloric acid.",
  "~Physical properties.~ Hydrochloric acid is a colorless gas which has an\nirritating effect when inhaled, and possesses a sour, biting taste, but\nno marked odor. It is heavier than air (density = 1.26) and is very\nsoluble in water. Under standard conditions 1 volume of water dissolves\nabout 500 volumes of the gas. On warming such a solution the gas\nescapes, until at the boiling point the solution contains about 20% by\nweight of HCl. Further boiling will not drive out any more acid, but the\nsolution will distill with unchanged concentration. A more dilute\nsolution than this will lose water on boiling until it has reached the\nsame concentration, 20%, and will then distill unchanged. Under high\npressure the gas can be liquefied, 28 atmospheres being required at 0°.\nUnder these conditions it forms a colorless liquid which is not very\nactive chemically. It boils at -80° and solidifies at -113°. The\nsolution of the gas in water is used almost entirely in the place of the\ngas itself, since it is not only far more convenient but also more\nactive.",
  "~Chemical properties.~ The most important chemical properties of\nhydrochloric acid are the following:",
  "1. _Action as an acid._ In aqueous solution hydrochloric acid has very\nstrong acid properties; indeed, it is one of the strongest acids. It\nacts upon oxides and hydroxides, converting them into salts:",
  "NaOH + HCl = NaCl + H_{2}O,\n    CuO + 2HCl = CuCl_{2} + H_{2}O.",
  "It acts upon many metals, forming chlorides and liberating hydrogen:",
  "Zn + 2HCl = ZnCl_{2} + 2H,\n    Al + 3HCl = AlCl_{3} + 3H.",
  "Unlike nitric and sulphuric acids it has no oxidizing action, so that\nwhen it acts on metals hydrogen is always given off.",
  "2. _Relation to combustion._ Hydrochloric acid gas is not readily\ndecomposed, and is therefore neither combustible nor a supporter of\ncombustion.",
  "3. _Action on oxidizing agents._ Although hydrochloric acid is\nincombustible, it can be oxidized under some circumstances, in which\ncase the hydrogen combines with oxygen, while the chlorine is set free.\nThus, when a solution of hydrochloric acid acts upon manganese dioxide\npart of the chlorine is set free:",
  "MnO_{2} + 4HCl = MnCl_{2} + 2H_{2}O + 2Cl.",
  "~Aqua regia.~ It has been seen that when nitric acid acts as an oxidizing\nagent it usually decomposes, as represented in the equation",
  "2HNO_{3} = H_{2}O + 2NO + 3O.",
  "The oxygen so set free may act on hydrochloric acid:",
  "6HCl + 3O = 3H_{2}O + 6Cl.",
  "The complete equation therefore is",
  "2HNO_{3} + 6HCl = 4H_{2}O + 2NO + 6Cl.",
  "When concentrated nitric and hydrochloric acids are mixed this reaction\ngoes on slowly, chlorine and some other substances not represented in\nthe equation being formed. The mixture is known as _aqua regia_ and is\ncommonly prepared by adding one volume of nitric acid to three volumes\nof hydrochloric acid. It acts more powerfully upon metals and other\nsubstances than either of the acids separately, and owes its strength\nnot to acid properties but to the action of the nascent chlorine which\nit liberates. Consequently, when it acts upon metals such as gold it\nconverts them into chlorides, and the reaction can be represented by\nsuch equations as",
  "Au + 3Cl = AuCl_{3}.",
  "~Salts of hydrochloric acid,--chlorides.~ The chlorides of all the metals\nare known and many of them are very important compounds. Some of them\nare found in nature, and all can be prepared by the general method of\npreparing salts. Silver chloride, lead chloride, and mercurous chloride\nare insoluble in water and acids, and can be prepared by adding\nhydrochloric acid to solutions of compounds of the respective elements.\nWhile the chlorides have formulas similar to the fluorides, their\nproperties are often quite different. This is seen in the solubility of\nthe salts. Those metals whose chlorides are insoluble form soluble\nfluorides, while many of the metals which form soluble chlorides form\ninsoluble fluorides.",
  "~Compounds of chlorine with oxygen and hydrogen.~ Chlorine combines with\noxygen and hydrogen to form four different acids. They are all quite\nunstable, and most of them cannot be prepared in pure form; their salts\ncan easily be made, however, and some of them will be met with in the\nstudy of the metals. The formulas and names of these acids are as\nfollows:",
  "HClO       hypochlorous acid.",
  "HClO_{2}   chlorous acid.",
  "HClO_{3}   chloric acid.",
  "HClO_{4}   perchloric acid.",
  "~Oxides of chlorine.~ Two oxides are known, having the formulas Cl_{2}O\nand ClO_{2}. They decompose very easily and are good oxidizing agents.",
  "BROMINE",
  "~Historical.~ Bromine was discovered in 1826 by the French chemist\nBallard, who isolated it from sea salt. He named it bromine (stench)\nbecause of its unbearable fumes.",
  "~Occurrence.~ Bromine occurs almost entirely in the form of bromides,\nespecially as sodium bromide and magnesium bromide, which are found in\nmany salt springs and salt deposits. The Stassfurt deposits in Germany\nand the salt waters of Ohio and Michigan are especially rich in\nbromides.",
  "~Preparation of bromine.~ The laboratory method of preparing bromine is\nessentially different from the commercial method.",
  "[Illustration Fig. 55]",
  "1. _Laboratory method._ As in the case of chlorine, bromine can be\nprepared by the action of hydrobromic acid (HBr) on manganese dioxide.\nSince hydrobromic acid is not an article of commerce, a mixture of\nsulphuric acid and a bromide is commonly substituted for it. The\nmaterials are placed in a retort arranged as shown in Fig. 55. The end\nof the retort just touches the surface of the water in the test tube. On\nheating, the bromine distills over and is collected in the cold\nreceiver. The equation is",
  "2NaBr + 2H_{2}SO_{4} + MnO_{2} = Na_{2}SO_{4} + MnSO_{4}\n      + 2H_{2}O + 2Br.",
  "2. _Commercial method._ Bromine is prepared commercially from the waters\nof salt wells which are especially rich in bromides. On passing a\ncurrent of electricity through such waters the bromine is first\nliberated. Any chlorine liberated, however, will assist in the reaction,\nsince free chlorine decomposes bromides, as shown in the equation",
  "NaBr + Cl = NaCl + Br.",
  "When the water containing the bromine is heated, the liberated bromine\ndistills over into the receiver.",
  "~Physical properties.~ Bromine is a dark red liquid about three times as\nheavy as water. Its vapor has a very offensive odor and is most\nirritating to the eyes and throat. The liquid boils at 59° and\nsolidifies at -7°; but even at ordinary temperatures it evaporates\nrapidly, forming a reddish-brown gas very similar to nitrogen peroxide\nin appearance. Bromine is somewhat soluble in water, 100 volumes of\nwater under ordinary conditions dissolving 1 volume of the liquid. It is\nreadily soluble in carbon disulphide, forming a yellow solution.",
  "~Chemical properties and uses.~ In chemical action bromine is very similar\nto chlorine. It combines directly with many of the same elements with\nwhich chlorine unites, but with less energy. It combines with hydrogen\nand takes away the latter element from some of its compounds, but not\nso readily as does chlorine. Its bleaching properties are also less\nmarked.",
  "Bromine finds many uses in the manufacture of organic drugs and\ndyestuffs and in the preparation of bromides.",
  "~Hydrobromic acid (HBr).~ When sulphuric acid acts upon a bromide\nhydrobromic acid is set free:",
  "2NaBr + H_{2}SO_{4} = Na_{2}SO_{4} + 2HBr.",
  "At the same time some bromine is set free, as may be seen from the red\nfumes which appear, and from the odor. The explanation of this is found\nin the fact that hydrobromic acid is much less stable than hydrochloric\nacid, and is therefore more easily oxidized. Concentrated sulphuric acid\nis a good oxidizing agent, and oxidizes a part of the hydrobromic acid,\nliberating bromine:",
  "H_{2}SO_{4} + 2HBr = 2H_{2}O + SO_{2} + 2Br.",
  "~Preparation of pure hydrobromic acid.~ A convenient way to make\n     pure hydrobromic acid is by the action of bromine upon moist\n     red phosphorus. This can be done with the apparatus shown in\n     Fig. 56. Bromine is put into the dropping funnel A, and red\n     phosphorus, together with enough water to cover it, is placed\n     in the flask B. By means of the stopcock the bromine is\n     allowed to flow drop by drop into the flask, the reaction\n     taking place without the application of heat. The equations are",
  "(1) P + 3Br = PBr_{3},",
  "(2) PBr_{3} + 3H_{2}O = P(OH)_{3} + 3HBr.",
  "[Illustration Fig. 56]",
  "The U-tube C contains glass beads which have been moistened\n     with water and rubbed in red phosphorus. Any bromine escaping\n     action in the flask acts upon the phosphorus in the U-tube. The\n     hydrobromic acid is collected in the same way as hydrochloric\n     acid.",
  "~Properties.~ Hydrobromic acid very strikingly resembles hydrochloric acid\nin physical and chemical properties. It is a colorless, strongly fuming\ngas, heavier than hydrochloric acid and, like it, is very soluble in\nwater. Under standard conditions 1 volume of water dissolves 610 volumes\nof the gas. Chemically, the chief point in which it differs from\nhydrochloric acid is in the fact that it is much more easily oxidized,\nso that bromine is more readily set free from it than chlorine is from\nhydrochloric acid.",
  "~Salts of hydrobromic acid,--bromides.~ The bromides are very similar to\nthe chlorides in their properties. Chlorine acts upon both bromides and\nfree hydrobromic acid, liberating bromine from them:",
  "KBr + Cl = KCl + Br,",
  "HBr + Cl = HCl + Br.",
  "Silver bromide is extensively used in photography, and the bromides of\nsodium and potassium are used as drugs.",
  "~Oxygen compounds.~ No oxides of bromine are surely known, and\n     bromine does not form so many oxygen acids as chlorine does.\n     Salts of hypobromous acid (HBrO) and bromic acid (HBrO_{3}) are\n     known.",
  "IODINE",
  "~Historical.~ Iodine was discovered in 1812 by Courtois in the ashes of\ncertain sea plants. Its presence was revealed by its beautiful violet\nvapor, and this suggested the name iodine (from the Greek for violet\nappearance).",
  "~Occurrence.~ In the combined state iodine occurs in very small quantities\nin sea water, from which it is absorbed by certain sea plants, so that\nit is found in their ashes. It occurs along with bromine in salt springs\nand beds, and is also found in Chili saltpeter.",
  "~Preparation.~ Iodine may be prepared in a number of ways, the principal\nmethods being the following:",
  "1. _Laboratory method._ Iodine can readily be prepared in the laboratory\nfrom an iodide by the method used in preparing bromine, except that\nsodium iodide is substituted for sodium bromide. It can also be made by\npassing chlorine into a solution of an iodide.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 57]",
  "2. _Commercial method._ Commercially iodine was formerly prepared from\nseaweed (kelp), but is now obtained almost entirely from the deposits of\nChili saltpeter. The crude saltpeter is dissolved in water and the\nsolution evaporated until the saltpeter crystallizes. The remaining\nliquors, known as the \"mother liquors,\" contain sodium iodate\n(NaIO_{3}), in which form the iodine is present in the saltpeter. The\nchemical reaction by which the iodine is liberated from this compound is\na complicated one, depending on the fact that sulphurous acid acts upon\niodic acid, setting iodine free. This reaction is shown as follows:",
  "2HIO_{3} + 5H_{2}SO_{3} = 5H_{2}SO_{4} + H_{2}O + 2I.",
  "~Purification of iodine.~ Iodine can be purified very\n     conveniently in the following way. The crude iodine is placed\n     in an evaporating dish E (Fig. 57), and the dish is set upon\n     the sand bath S. The iodine is covered with the inverted\n     funnel F, and the sand bath is gently heated with a Bunsen\n     burner. As the dish becomes warm the iodine rapidly evaporates\n     and condenses again on the cold surface of the funnel in\n     shining crystals.",
  "This process, in which a solid is converted into a vapor and is\n     again condensed into a solid without passing through the liquid\n     state, is called _sublimation_.",
  "~Physical properties.~ Iodine is a purplish-black, shining, heavy solid\nwhich crystallizes in brilliant plates. Even at ordinary temperatures it\ngives off a beautiful violet vapor, which increases in amount as heat is\napplied. It melts at 107° and boils at 175°. It is slightly soluble in\nwater, but readily dissolves in alcohol, forming a brown solution\n(tincture of iodine), and in carbon disulphide, forming a violet\nsolution. The element has a strong, unpleasant odor, though by no means\nas irritating as that of chlorine and bromine.",
  "~Chemical properties.~ Chemically iodine is quite similar to chlorine and\nbromine, but is still less active than bromine. It combines directly\nwith many elements at ordinary temperatures. At elevated temperatures it\ncombines with hydrogen, but the reaction is reversible and the compound\nformed is quite easily decomposed. Both chlorine and bromine displace it\nfrom its salts:",
  "KI + Br = KBr + I,",
  "KI + Cl = KCl + I.",
  "When even minute traces of iodine are added to thin starch paste a very\nintense blue color develops, and this reaction forms a delicate test for\niodine. Iodine is extensively used in medicine, especially in the form\nof a tincture. It is also largely used in the preparation of dyes and\norganic drugs, iodoform, a substance used as an antiseptic, has the\nformula CHI_{3}.",
  "~Hydriodic acid (HI).~ This acid cannot be prepared in pure condition by\nthe action of sulphuric acid upon an iodide, since the hydriodic acid\nset free is oxidized by the sulphuric acid just as in the case of\nhydrobromic acid, but to a much greater extent. It can be prepared in\nexactly the same way as hydrobromic acid, iodine being substituted for\nbromine. It can also be prepared by passing hydrosulphuric acid into\nwater in which iodine is suspended. The equation is",
  "H_{2}S + 2I = 2HI + S.",
  "The hydriodic acid formed in this way dissolves in the water.",
  "~Properties and uses.~ Hydriodic acid resembles the corresponding acids of\nchlorine and bromine in physical properties, being a strongly fuming,\ncolorless gas, readily soluble in water. Under standard conditions 1\nvolume of water dissolves about 460 volumes of the gas. It is, however,\nmore unstable than either hydrochloric or hydrobromic acids, and on\nexposure to the air it gradually decomposes in accordance with the\nequation",
  "2HI + O = H_{2}O + 2I.",
  "Owing to the slight affinity between iodine and hydrogen the acid easily\ngives up its hydrogen and is therefore a strong reducing agent. This is\nseen in its action on sulphuric acid.",
  "The salts of hydriodic acid, the iodides, are, in general, similar to\nthe chlorides and bromides. Potassium iodide (KI) is the most familiar\nof the iodides and is largely used in medicine.",
  "~Oxygen compounds.~ Iodine has a much greater affinity for oxygen\n     than has either chlorine or bromine. When heated with nitric\n     acid it forms a stable oxide (I_{2}O_{5}). Salts of iodic acid\n     (HIO_{3}) and periodic acid (HIO_{4}) are easily prepared, and\n     the free acids are much more stable than the corresponding\n     acids of the other members of this family.",
  "GAY-LUSSAC'S LAW OF VOLUMES",
  "In the discussion of the composition of hydrochloric acid it was stated\nthat one volume of hydrogen combines with one volume of chlorine to form\ntwo volumes of hydrochloric acid. With bromine and iodine similar\ncombining ratios hold good. These facts recall the simple volume\nrelations already noted in the study of the composition of steam and\nammonia. These relations may be represented graphically in the following\nway:",
  "+---+   +----+    +------+    +------+\n              | H | + | Cl | =  | H Cl |  + | H Cl |\n              +---+   +----+    +------+    +------+",

  "In the early part of the past century Gay-Lussac, a distinguished French\nchemist, studied the volume relations of many combining gases, and\nconcluded that similar relations always hold. His observations are\nsummed up in the following law: _When two gases combine chemically there\nis always a simple ratio between their volumes, and between the volume\nof either one of them and that of the product, provided it is a gas._ By\na simple ratio is meant of course the ratio of small whole numbers, as\n1 : 2, 2 : 3.",

  "CHAPTER XVII",
  "CARBON AND SOME OF ITS SIMPLER COMPOUNDS",
  "~The family.~ Carbon stands at the head of a family of elements in the\nfourth group in the periodic table. The resemblances between the\nelements of this family, while quite marked, are not so striking as in\nthe case of the elements of the chlorine family. With the exception of\ncarbon, these elements are comparatively rare, and need not be taken up\nin detail in this chapter. Titanium will be referred to again in\nconnection with silicon which it very closely resembles.",
  "~Occurrence.~ Carbon is found in nature in the uncombined state in several\nforms. The diamond is practically pure carbon, while graphite and coal\nare largely carbon, but contain small amounts of other substances. Its\nnatural compounds are exceedingly numerous and occur as gases, liquids,\nand solids. Carbon dioxide is its most familiar gaseous compound.\nNatural gas and petroleum are largely compounds of carbon with hydrogen.\nThe carbonates, especially calcium carbonate, constitute great strata of\nrocks, and are found in almost every locality. All living organisms,\nboth plant and animal, contain a large percentage of this element, and\nthe number of its compounds which go to make up all the vast variety of\nanimate nature is almost limitless. Over one hundred thousand definite\ncompounds containing carbon have been prepared. In the free state carbon\noccurs in three allotropic forms, two of which are crystalline and one\namorphous.",
  "~Crystalline carbon.~ Crystalline carbon occurs in two forms,--diamond and\ngraphite.",
  "1. _Diamond._ Diamonds are found in considerable quantities in several\nlocalities, especially in South Africa, the East Indies, and Brazil. The\ncrystals belong to the regular system, but the natural stones do not\nshow this very clearly. When found they are usually covered with a rough\ncoating which is removed in the process of cutting. Diamond cutting is\ncarried on most extensively in Holland.",
  "The density of the diamond is 3.5, and, though brittle, it is one of the\nhardest of substances. Black diamonds, as well as broken and imperfect\nstones which are valueless as gems, are used for grinding hard\nsubstances. Few chemical reagents have any action on the diamond, but\nwhen heated in oxygen or the air it blackens and burns, forming carbon\ndioxide.",
  "Lavoisier first showed that carbon dioxide is formed by the combustion\nof the diamond; and Sir Humphry Davy in 1814 showed that this is the\nonly product of combustion, and that the diamond is pure carbon.",
  "~The diamond as a gem.~ The pure diamond is perfectly transparent\n     and colorless, but many are tinted a variety of colors by\n     traces of foreign substances. Usually the colorless ones are\n     the most highly prized, although in some instances the color\n     adds to the value; thus the famous Hope diamond is a beautiful\n     blue. Light passing through a diamond is very much refracted,\n     and to this fact the stone owes its brilliancy and sparkle.",
  "~Artificial preparation of diamonds.~ Many attempts have been\n     made to produce diamonds artificially, but for a long time\n     these always ended in failure, graphite and not diamonds being\n     the product obtained. The French chemist Moissan, in his\n     extended study of chemistry at high temperatures, finally\n     succeeded (1893) in making some small ones. He accomplished\n     this by dissolving carbon in boiling iron and plunging the\n     crucible containing the mixture into water, as shown in Fig.\n     58. Under these conditions the carbon crystallized in the iron\n     in the form of the diamond. The diamonds were then obtained by\n     dissolving away the iron in hydrochloric acid.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 58]",
  "2. _Graphite._ This form of carbon is found in large quantities,\nespecially in Ceylon, Siberia, and in some localities of the United\nStates and Canada. It is a shining black substance, very soft and greasy\nto the touch. Its density is about 2.15. It varies somewhat in\nproperties according to the locality in which it is found, and is more\neasily attacked by reagents than is the diamond. It is also manufactured\nby heating carbon with a small amount of iron (3%) in an electric\nfurnace. It is used in the manufacture of lead pencils and crucibles, as\na lubricant, and as a protective covering for iron in the form of a\npolish or a paint.",
  "~Amorphous carbon.~ Although there are many varieties of amorphous carbon\nknown, they are not true allotropic modifications. They differ merely in\ntheir degree of purity, their fineness of division, and in their mode of\npreparation. These substances are of the greatest importance, owing to\ntheir many uses in the arts and industries. As they occur in nature, or\nare made artificially, they are nearly all impure carbon, the impurity\ndepending on the particular substance in question.",
  "1. _Pure carbon._ Pure amorphous carbon is best prepared by charring\nsugar. This is a substance consisting of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen,\nthe latter two elements being present in the ratio of one oxygen atom to\ntwo of hydrogen. When sugar is strongly heated the oxygen and hydrogen\nare driven off in the form of water and pure carbon is left behind.\nPrepared in this way it is a soft, lustrous, very bulky, black powder.",
  "2. _Coal and coke._ Coals of various kinds were probably formed from\nvast accumulations of vegetable matter in former ages, which became\ncovered over with earthy material and were thus protected from rapid\ndecay. Under various natural agencies the organic matter was slowly\nchanged into coal. In anthracite these changes have gone the farthest,\nand this variety of coal is nearly pure carbon. Soft or bituminous coals\ncontain considerable organic matter besides carbon and mineral\nsubstances. When heated strongly out of contact with air the organic\nmatter is decomposed and the resulting volatile matter is driven off in\nthe form of gases and vapors, and only the mineral matter and carbon\nremain behind. The gaseous product is chiefly illuminating gas and the\nsolid residue is _coke_. Some of the coke is found as a dense cake on\nthe sides and roof of the retort. This is called retort carbon and is\nquite pure.",
  "3. _Charcoal._ This is prepared from wood in the same way that coke is\nmade from coal. When the process is carried on in retorts the products\nexpelled by the heat are saved. Among these are many valuable substances\nsuch as wood alcohol and acetic acid. Where timber is abundant the\nprocess is carried out in a wasteful way, by merely covering piles of\nwood with sod and setting the wood on fire. Some wood burns and the heat\nfrom this decomposes the wood not burned, forming charcoal from it. The\ncharcoal, of course, contains the mineral part of the wood from which it\nis formed.",
  "4. _Bone black._ This is sometimes called animal charcoal, and is made\nby charring bones and animal refuse. The organic part of the materials\nis thus decomposed and carbon is left in a very finely divided state,\nscattered through the mineral part which consists largely of calcium\nphosphate. For some uses this mineral part is removed by treatment with\nhydrochloric acid and prolonged washing.",
  "5. _Lampblack._ Lampblack and soot are products of imperfect combustion\nof oil and coal, and are deposited from a smoky flame on a cold surface.\nThe carbon in this form is very finely divided and usually contains\nvarious oily materials.",
  "~Properties.~ While the various forms of carbon differ in many properties,\nespecially in color and hardness, yet they are all odorless, tasteless\nsolids, insoluble in water and characterized by their stability towards\nheat. Only in the intense heat of the electric arc does carbon\nvolatilize, passing directly from the solid state into a vapor. Owing to\nthis fact the inside surface of an incandescent light bulb after being\nused for some time becomes coated with a dark film of carbon. It is not\nacted on at ordinary temperatures by most reagents, but at a higher\ntemperature it combines directly with many of the elements, forming\ncompounds called _carbides_. When heated in the presence of sufficient\noxygen it burns, forming carbon dioxide.",
  "~Uses of carbon.~ The chief use of amorphous carbon is for fuel to furnish\nheat and power for all the uses of civilization. An enormous quantity of\ncarbon in the form of the purer coals, coke, and charcoal is used as a\nreducing agent in the manufacture of the various metals, especially in\nthe metallurgy of iron. Most of the metals are found in nature as\noxides, or in forms which can readily be converted into oxides. When\nthese oxides are heated with carbon the oxygen is abstracted, leaving\nthe metal. Retort carbon and coke are used to make electric light\ncarbons and battery plates, while lampblack is used for indelible inks,\nprinter's ink, and black varnishes. Bone black and charcoal have the\nproperty of absorbing large volumes of certain gases, as well as smaller\namounts of organic matter; hence they are used in filters to remove\nnoxious gases and objectionable colors and odors from water. Bone black\nis used extensively in the sugar refineries to remove coloring matter\nfrom the impure sugars.",
  "~Chemistry of carbon compounds.~ Carbon is remarkable for the very large\nnumber of compounds which it forms with the other elements, especially\nwith oxygen and hydrogen. Compounds containing carbon are more numerous\nthan all others put together, and the chemistry of these substances\npresents peculiarities not met with in the study of other substances.\nFor these reasons the systematic study of carbon compounds, or of\n_organic chemistry_ as it is usually called, must be deferred until the\nstudent has gained some knowledge of the chemistry of other elements. An\nacquaintance with a few of the most familiar carbon compounds is,\nhowever, essential for the understanding of the general principles of\nchemistry.",
  "~Compounds of carbon with hydrogen,--the hydrocarbons.~ Carbon unites with\nhydrogen to form a very large number of compounds called _hydrocarbons_.\nPetroleum and natural gas are essentially mixtures of a great variety of\nthese hydrocarbons. Many others are found in living plants, and still\nothers are produced by the decay of organic matter in the absence of\nair. Only two of them, methane and acetylene, will be discussed here.",
  "~Methane~ (_marsh gas_) (CH_{4}). This is one of the most important of\nthese hydrocarbons, and constitutes about nine tenths of natural gas. As\nits name suggests, it is formed in marshes by the decay of vegetable\nmatter under water, and bubbles of the gas are often seen to rise when\nthe dead leaves on the bottom of pools are stirred. It also collects in\nmines, and, when mixed with air, is called _fire damp_ by the miners\nbecause of its great inflammability, damp being an old name for a gas.\nIt is formed when organic matter, such as coal or wood, is heated in\nclosed vessels, and is therefore a principal constituent of coal gas.",
  "~Preparation.~ Methane is prepared in the laboratory by heating sodium or\ncalcium acetate with soda-lime. Equal weights of fused sodium acetate\nand soda-lime are thoroughly dried, then mixed and placed in a\ngood-sized, hard-glass test tube fitted with a one-holed stopper and\ndelivery tube. The mixture is gradually heated, and when the air has\nbeen displaced from the tube the gas is collected in bottles by\ndisplacement of water. Soda-lime is a mixture of sodium and calcium\nhydroxides. Regarding it as sodium hydroxide alone, the equation is",
  "NaC_{2}H_{3}O_{2} + NaOH = Na_{2}CO_{3} + CH_{4}.",
  "~Properties.~ Methane is a colorless, odorless gas whose density is 0.55.\nIt is difficult to liquefy, boiling at -155° under standard pressure,\nand is almost insoluble in water. It burns with a pale blue flame,\nliberating much heat, and when mixed with oxygen is very explosive.",
  "~Davy's safety lamp.~ In 1815 Sir Humphry Davy invented a lamp for the use\nof miners, to prevent the dreadful mine explosions then common, due to\nmethane mixed with air. The invention consisted in surrounding the upper\npart of the common miner's lamp with a mantle of wire gauze and the\nlower part with glass (Fig. 59). It has been seen that two gases will\nnot combine until raised to their kindling temperature, and if while\ncombining they are cooled below this point, the combination ceases. A\nflame will not pass through a wire gauze because the metal, being a good\nconductor of heat, takes away so much heat from the flame that the gases\nare cooled below the kindling temperature. When a lamp so protected is\nbrought into an explosive mixture the gases inside the wire mantle burn\nin a series of little explosions, giving warning to the miner that the\nair is unsafe.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 59]",
  "~Acetylene~ (C_{2}H_{2}). This is a colorless gas usually having a\ndisagreeable odor due to impurities. It is now made in large quantities\nfrom calcium carbide (CaC_{2}). This substance is formed when coal and\nlime are heated together in an electric furnace. When treated with water\nthe carbide is decomposed, yielding acetylene:",
  "CaC_{2} + 2H_{2}O = C_{2}H_{2} + Ca(OH)_{2}.",
  "Under ordinary conditions the gas burns with a very smoky flame; in\nburners constructed so as to secure a large amount of oxygen it burns\nwith a very brilliant white light, and hence is used as an illuminant.",
  "~Laboratory preparation.~ The gas can be prepared readily in a generator\nsuch as is shown in Fig. 60. The inner tube contains fragments of\ncalcium carbide, while the outer one is filled with water. As long as\nthe stopcock is closed the water cannot rise in the inner tube. When the\nstopcock is open the water rises, and, coming into contact with the\ncarbide in the inner tube, generates acetylene. This escapes through the\nstopcock, and after the air has been expelled may be lighted as it\nissues from the burner.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 60]",
  "Carbon forms two oxides, namely, carbon dioxide (CO_{2}) and carbon\nmonoxide (CO).",
  "~Carbon dioxide~ (CO_{2}). Carbon dioxide is present in the air to the\nextent of about 3 parts in 10,000, and this apparently small amount is\nof fundamental importance in nature. In some localities it escapes from\nthe earth in great quantities, and many spring waters carry large\namounts of it in solution. When these highly charged spring waters reach\nthe surface of the earth, and the pressure on them is removed, the\ncarbon dioxide escapes with effervescence. It is a product of the\noxidation of all organic matter, and is therefore formed in fires as\nwell as in the process of decay. It is thrown off from the lungs of all\nanimals in respiration, and is a product of many fermentation processes\nsuch as vinegar making and brewing. Combined with metallic oxides it\nforms vast deposits of carbonates in nature.",
  "~Preparation.~ In the laboratory carbon dioxide is always prepared by the\naction of an acid upon a carbonate, usually calcium carbonate, the\napparatus shown in Fig. 39 serving the purpose very well. This reaction\nmight be expected to produce carbonic acid, thus:",
  "CaCO_{3} + 2HCl = CaCl_{2} + H_{2}CO_{3}.",
  "Carbonic acid is very unstable, however, and decomposes into its\nanhydride, CO_{2}, and water, thus:",
  "H_{2}CO_{3} = H_{2}O + CO_{2}.",
  "The complete reaction is represented by the equation",
  "CaCO_{3} + 2HCl = CaCl_{2} + CO_{2} + H_{2}O.",
  "~Physical properties.~ Carbon dioxide is a colorless, practically odorless\ngas whose density is 1.5. Its weight may be inferred from the fact that\nit can be siphoned, or poured like water, from one vessel downward into\nanother. At 15° and under ordinary pressure it dissolves in its own\nvolume of water and imparts a somewhat biting, pungent taste to it. It\nis easily condensed, and is now prepared commercially in this form by\npumping the gas into steel cylinders (see Fig. 6) which are kept cold\nduring the process. When the liquid is permitted to escape into the air\npart of it instantly evaporates, and in so doing absorbs so much heat\nthat another portion is solidified, the solid form strikingly resembling\nsnow in appearance. This snow is very cold and mercury can easily be\nfrozen with it.",
  "~Solid carbon dioxide.~ Cylinders of liquid carbon dioxide are\ninexpensive, and should be available in every school. To demonstrate the\nproperties of solid carbon dioxide, the cylinder should be placed across\nthe table and supported in such a way that the stopcock end is several\ninches lower than the other end. A loose bag is made by holding the\ncorners of a handkerchief around the neck of the stopcock, and the cock\nis then turned on so that the gas rushes out in large quantities. Very\nquickly a considerable quantity of the snow collects in the\nhandkerchief. To freeze mercury, press a piece of filter paper into a\nsmall evaporating dish and pour the mercury upon it. Coil a flat spiral\nupon the end of a wire, and dip the spiral into the mercury. Place a\nquantity of solid carbon dioxide upon the mercury and pour 10 cc.-15 cc.\nof ether over it. In a minute or two the mercury will solidify and may\nbe removed from the dish by the wire serving as a handle. The filter\npaper is to prevent the mercury from sticking to the dish; the ether\ndissolves the solid carbon dioxide and promotes its rapid conversion\ninto gas.",
  "~Chemical properties.~ Carbon dioxide is incombustible, since it is, like\nwater, a product of combustion. It does not support combustion, as does\nnitrogen peroxide, because the oxygen in it is held in very firm\nchemical union with the carbon. Very strong reducing agents, such as\nhighly heated carbon, can take away half of its oxygen:",
  "CO_{2} + C = 2CO.",
  "~Uses.~ The relation of carbon dioxide to plant life has been discussed in\na previous chapter. Water highly charged with carbon dioxide is used for\nmaking soda water and similar beverages. Since it is a non-supporter of\ncombustion and can be generated readily, carbon dioxide is also used as\na fire extinguisher. Some of the portable fire extinguishers are simply\ndevices for generating large amounts of the gas. It is not necessary\nthat all the oxygen should be kept away from the fire in order to\nsmother it. A burning candle is extinguished in air which contains only\n2.5% of carbon dioxide.",
  "~Carbonic acid~ (H_{2}CO_{3}). Like most of the oxides of the non-metallic\nelements, carbon dioxide is an acid anhydride. It combines with water to\nform an acid of the formula H_{2}CO_{3}, called carbonic acid:",
  "H_{2}O + CO_{2} = H_{2}CO_{3}.",
  "The acid is, however, very unstable and cannot be isolated. Only a very\nsmall amount of it is actually formed when carbon dioxide is passed into\nwater, as is evident from the small solubility of the gas. If, however,\na base is present in the water, salts of carbonic acid are formed, and\nthese are quite stable:",
  "2NaOH + H_{2}O + CO_{2} = Na_{2}CO_{3} + 2H_{2}O.",
  "~Action of carbon dioxide on bases.~ This conduct is explained by the\nprinciples of reversible reactions. The equation",
  "H_{2}O +CO_{2} <--> H_{2}CO_{3}",
  "is a reversible equation, and the extent to which the reaction\nprogresses depends upon the relative concentrations of each of the three\nfactors in it. Equilibrium is ordinarily reached when very little\nH_{2}CO_{3} is formed. If a base is present in the water to combine with\nthe H_{2}CO_{3} as fast as it is formed, all of the CO_{2} is converted\ninto H_{2}CO_{3}, and thence into a carbonate.",
  "~Salts of carbonic acid,--carbonates.~ The carbonates form a very\nimportant class of salts. They are found in large quantities in nature,\nand are often used in chemical processes. Only the carbonates of sodium,\npotassium, and ammonium are soluble, and these can be made by the action\nof carbon dioxide on solutions of the bases, as has just been explained.",
  "The insoluble carbonates are formed as precipitates when soluble salts\nare treated with a solution of a soluble carbonate. Thus the insoluble\ncalcium carbonate can be made by bringing together solutions of calcium\nchloride and sodium carbonate:",
  "CaCl_{2} + Na_{2}CO_{3} = CaCO_{3} + 2NaCl.",
  "Most of the carbonates are decomposed by heat, yielding an oxide of the\nmetal and carbon dioxide. Thus lime (calcium oxide) is made by strongly\nheating calcium carbonate:",
  "CaCO_{3} = CaO + CO_{2}.",
  "~Acid carbonates.~ Like all acids containing two acid hydrogen atoms,\ncarbonic acid can form both normal and acid salts. The acid carbonates\nare made by treating a normal carbonate with an excess of carbonic acid.\nWith few exceptions they are very unstable, heat decomposing them even\nwhen in solution.",
  "~Action of carbon dioxide on calcium hydroxide.~ If carbon dioxide is\npassed into clear lime water, calcium carbonate is at first\nprecipitated:",
  "H_{2}O + CO_{2} = H_{2}CO_{3},",
  "Ca(OH)_{2} + H_{2}CO_{3} = CaCO_{3} + 2H_{2}O.",
  "Advantage is taken of this reaction in testing for the presence of\ncarbon dioxide, as already explained in the chapter on the atmosphere.\nIf the current of carbon dioxide is continued, the precipitate soon\ndissolves, because the excess of carbonic acid forms calcium acid\ncarbonate which is soluble:",
  "CaCO_{3} + H_{2}CO_{3} = Ca(HCO_{3})_{2}.",
  "If now the solution is heated, the acid carbonate is decomposed and\ncalcium carbonate once more precipitated:",
  "Ca(HCO_{3})_{2} = CaCO_{3} + H_{2}CO_{3}.",
  "~Carbon monoxide (CO).~ Carbon monoxide can be made in a number of ways,\nthe most important of which are the three following:",
  "1. _By the partial oxidation of carbon._ If a slow current of air is\nconducted over highly heated carbon, the monoxide is formed, thus:",
  "C + O = CO",
  "It is therefore often formed in stoves when the air draught is\ninsufficient. Water gas, which contains large amounts of carbon\nmonoxide, is made by partially oxidizing carbon with steam:",
  "C + H_{2}O = CO + 2H.",
  "2. _By the partial reduction of carbon dioxide._ When carbon dioxide is\nconducted over highly heated carbon it is reduced to carbon monoxide by\nthe excess of carbon:",
  "CO_{2} + C = 2CO.",
  "When coal is burning in a stove or grate carbon dioxide is at first\nformed in the free supply of air, but as the hot gas rises through the\nglowing coal it is reduced to carbon monoxide. When the carbon monoxide\nreaches the free air above the coal it takes up oxygen to form carbon\ndioxide, burning with the blue flame so familiar above a bed of coals,\nespecially in the case of hard coals.",
  "3. _By the decomposition of oxalic acid._ In the laboratory carbon\nmonoxide is usually prepared by the action of concentrated sulphuric\nacid upon oxalic acid. The latter substance has the formula\nC_{2}H_{2}O_{4}. The sulphuric acid, owing to its affinity for water,\ndecomposes the oxalic acid, as represented in the equation",
  "C_{2}H_{2}O_{4} + (H_{2}SO_{4}) = (H_{2}SO_{4}) + H_{2}O + CO_{2} + CO.",
  "~Properties.~ Carbon monoxide is a light, colorless, almost odorless gas,\nvery difficult to liquefy. Chemically it is very active, combining\ndirectly with a great many substances. It has a great affinity for\noxygen and is therefore combustible and a good reducing agent. Thus, if\ncarbon monoxide is passed over hot copper oxide, the copper is reduced\nto the metallic state:",
  "CuO + CO = Cu + CO_{2}.",
  "When inhaled it combines with the red coloring matter of the blood and\nin this way prevents the absorption of oxygen, so that even a small\nquantity of the gas may prove fatal.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 61]",
  "~The reducing power of carbon monoxide.~ Fig. 61 illustrates a\n     method of showing the reducing power of carbon monoxide. The\n     gas is generated by gently heating 7 or 8 g. of oxalic acid\n     with 25 cc. of concentrated sulphuric acid in a 200 cc. flask\n     A. The bottle B contains a solution of sodium hydroxide,\n     which removes the carbon dioxide formed along with the\n     monoxide. C contains a solution of calcium hydroxide to show\n     that the carbon dioxide is completely removed. E is a\n     hard-glass tube containing 1 or 2 g. of copper oxide, which is\n     heated by a burner. The black copper oxide is reduced to\n     reddish metallic copper by the carbon monoxide, which is\n     thereby changed to carbon dioxide. The presence of the carbon\n     dioxide is shown by the precipitate in the calcium hydroxide\n     solution in D. Any unchanged carbon monoxide is collected\n     over water in F.",
  "~Carbon disulphide~ (CS_{2}). Just as carbon combines with oxygen to form\ncarbon dioxide, so it combines with sulphur to form carbon disulphide\n(CS_{2}). This compound has been described in the chapter on sulphur.",
  "~Hydrocyanic acid~ (_prussic acid_)(HCN). Under the proper conditions\ncarbon unites with nitrogen and hydrogen to form the acid HCN, called\nhydrocyanic acid. It is a weak, volatile acid, and is therefore easily\nprepared by treating its salts with sulphuric acid:",
  "KCN + H_{2}SO_{4} = KHSO_{4} + HCN.",
  "It is most familiar as a gas, though it condenses to a colorless liquid\nboiling at 26°. It has a peculiar odor, suggesting bitter almonds, and\nis extremely poisonous either when inhaled or when taken into the\nstomach. A single drop may cause death. It dissolves readily in water,\nits solution being commonly called prussic acid.",
  "The salts of hydrocyanic acid are called _cyanides_, the cyanides of\nsodium and potassium being the best known. These are white solids and\nare extremely poisonous.",
  "~Solutions of potassium cyanide are alkaline.~ A solution of potassium\ncyanide turns red litmus blue, and must therefore contain hydroxyl ions.\nThe presence of these ions is accounted for in the following way.",
  "Although water is so little dissociated into its ions H^{+} and OH^{-}\nthat for most purposes we may neglect the dissociation, it is\nnevertheless measurably dissociated. Hydrocyanic acid is one of the\nweakest of acids, and dissociates to an extremely slight extent. When a\ncyanide such as potassium cyanide dissolves it freely dissociates, and\nthe CN^{-} ions must come to an equilibrium with the H^{+} ions derived\nfrom the water:",
  "H^{+} + CN^{-} <--> HCN.",
  "The result of this equilibrium is that quite a number of H^{+} ions from\nthe water are converted into undissociated HCN molecules. But for every\nH^{+} ion so removed an OH^{-} ion remains free, and this will give the\nsolution alkaline properties.",

  "FLAMES,--ILLUMINANTS",
  "~Conditions necessary for flames.~ It has been seen that when two\nsubstances unite chemically, with the production of light and heat, the\nact of union is called combustion. When one of the substances undergoing\ncombustion remains solid at the temperature occasioned by the\ncombustion, light may be given off, but there is no flame. Thus iron\nwire burning in oxygen throws off a shower of sparks and is brilliantly\nincandescent, but no flame is seen. When, however, both of the\nsubstances are gases or vapors at the temperature reached in the\ncombustion, the act of union is accompanied by a flame.",
  "~Flames from burning liquids or solids.~ Many substances which are liquids\nor solids at ordinary temperatures burn with a flame because the heat of\ncombustion vaporizes them slowly, and the flame is due to the union of\nthis vapor with the gas supporting the combustion.",
  "~Supporter of combustion.~ That gas which surrounds the flame and\nconstitutes the atmosphere in which the combustion occurs is said to\nsupport the combustion. The other gas which issues into this atmosphere\nis said to be the combustible gas. Thus, in the ordinary combustion of\ncoal gas in the air the coal gas is said to be combustible, while the\nair is regarded as the supporter of combustion. These terms are entirely\nrelative, however, for a jet of air issuing into an atmosphere of coal\ngas will burn when ignited, the coal gas supporting the combustion.\nOrdinarily, when we say that a gas is combustible we mean that it is\ncombustible in an atmosphere of air.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 62]",
  "~Either gas may be the supporter of combustion.~ That the terms\n_combustible_ and _supporter of combustion_ are merely relative may be\nshown in the following way: A lamp chimney A is fitted with a cork and\nglass tubes, as shown in Fig. 62. The tube C should have a diameter of\nfrom 12 to 15 mm. A thin sheet of asbestos in which is cut a circular\nopening about 2 cm. in diameter is placed over the top of the chimney.\nThe opening in the asbestos is closed with the palm of the hand, and gas\nis admitted to the chimney through the tube B. The air in the chimney\nis soon expelled through the tube C, and the gas itself is then\nlighted at the lower end of this tube. The hand is now removed from the\nopening in the asbestos, when the flame at the end of the tube at once\nrises and appears at the end within the chimney, as shown in the figure.\nThe excess of coal gas now escapes from the opening in the asbestos and\nmay be lighted. The flame at the top of the asbestos board is due to the\ncombustion of coal gas in air, while the flame within the chimney is due\nto the combustion of air in coal gas, the air being drawn up through the\ntube by the escaping gas.",
  "~Appearance of flames.~ The flame caused by the union of hydrogen and\noxygen is almost colorless and invisible. Chlorine and hydrogen combine\nwith a pale violet flame, carbon monoxide burns in oxygen with a blue\nflame, while ammonia burns with a deep yellow flame. The color and\nappearance of flames are therefore often quite characteristic of the\nparticular combustion which occasions them.",
  "~Structure of flames.~ When the gas undergoing combustion issues from a\nround opening into an atmosphere of the gas supporting combustion, as is\nthe case with the burning Bunsen burner (Fig. 63), the flame is\ngenerally conical in outline. It consists of several distinct cones,\none within the other, the boundary between them being marked by\ndifferences of color or luminosity. In the simplest flame, of which\nhydrogen burning in oxygen is a good example, these cones are two in\nnumber,--an inner one, formed by unburned gas, and an outer one, usually\nmore or less luminous, consisting of the combining gases. This outer one\nis in turn surrounded by a third envelope of the products of combustion;\nthis envelope is sometimes invisible, as in the present case, but is\nsometimes faintly luminous. The lower part of the inner cone of the\nflame is quite cool and consists of unburned gas. Toward the top of the\ninner cone the gas has become heated to a high temperature by the\nburning envelope surrounding it. On reaching the supporter of combustion\non the outside it is far above its kindling temperature, and combustion\nfollows with the evolution of much heat. The region of combustion just\noutside the inner cone is therefore the hottest part of the flame.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 63]",
  "~Oxidizing and reducing flames.~ Since the tip of the outside cone\nconsists of very hot products of combustion mixed with oxygen from the\nair, a substance capable of oxidation placed in this part of the flame\nbecomes very hot and is easily oxidized. The oxygen with which it\ncombines comes, of course, from the atmosphere, and not from the\nproducts of combustion. This outer tip of the flame is called the\n_oxidizing flame_.",
  "At the tip of the inner cone the conditions are quite different. This\nregion consists of a highly heated combustible gas, which has not yet\nreached a supply of oxygen.",
  "If a substance rich in oxygen, such as a metallic oxide, is placed in\nthis region of the flame, the heated gases combine with its oxygen and\nthe substance is reduced. This part of the flame is called the _reducing\nflame_. These flames are used in testing certain substances, especially\nminerals. For this purpose they are produced by blowing into a small\nluminous Bunsen flame from one side through a blowpipe. This is a tube\nof the shape shown in Fig. 64. The flame is directed in any desired way\nand has the oxidizing and reducing regions very clearly marked (Fig.\n65). It is non-luminous from the same causes which render the open\nBunsen burner flame non-luminous, the gases from the lungs serving to\nfurnish oxygen and to dilute the combustible gas.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 64]",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 65]",
  "~Luminosity of flames.~ The luminosity of flames is due to a number of\ndistinct causes, and may therefore be increased or diminished in several\nways.",
  "1. _Presence of solid matter._ The most obvious of these causes is the\npresence in the flame of incandescent solid matter. Thus chalk dust\nsifted into a non-luminous flame renders it luminous. When hydrocarbons\nform a part of the combustible gas, as they do in nearly all\nilluminating gases and oils, some carbon is usually set free in the\nprocess of combustion. This is made very hot by the flame and becomes\nincandescent, giving out light. In a well-regulated flame it is\nafterward burned up, but when the supply of oxygen is insufficient it\nescapes from the flame as lampblack or soot. That it is temporarily\npresent in a well-burning luminous flame may be demonstrated by holding\na cold object, such as a small evaporating dish, in the flame for a few\nseconds. This cold object cools the carbon below its kindling\ntemperature, and it is deposited on the object as soot.",
  "2. _Pressure._ A second factor in the luminosity of flames is the\npressure under which the gases are burning. Under increased pressure\nthere is more matter in a given volume of a gas, and the chemical action\nis more energetic than when the gases are rarefied. Consequently there\nis more heat and light. A candle burning on a high mountain gives less\nlight than when it burns at the sea level.",
  "If the gas is diluted with a non-combustible gas, the effect is the same\nas if it is rarefied, for under these conditions there is less\ncombustible gas in a given volume.",
  "3. _Temperature._ The luminosity also depends upon the temperature\nattained in the combustion. In general the hotter the flame the greater\nthe luminosity; hence cooling the gases before combustion diminishes the\nluminosity of the flame they will make, because it diminishes the\ntemperature attained in the combustion. Thus the luminosity of the\nBunsen flame is largely diminished by the air drawn up with the gas.\nThis is due in part to the fact that the burning gas is diluted and\ncooled by the air drawn in. The oxygen thus introduced into the flame\nalso causes the combustion of the hot particles of carbon which would\notherwise tend to make the flame luminous.",
  "~Illuminating and fuel gases.~ A number of mixtures of combustible gases,\nconsisting largely of carbon compounds and hydrogen, find extensive use\nfor the production of light and heat. The three chief varieties are coal\ngas, water gas, and natural gas. The use of acetylene gas has already\nbeen referred to.",
  "~Coal gas.~ Coal gas is made by heating bituminous coal in large retorts\nout of contact with the air. Soft or bituminous coal contains, in\naddition to large amounts of carbon, considerable quantities of\ncompounds of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulphur. When distilled the\nnitrogen is liberated partly in the form of ammonia and cyanides and\npartly as free nitrogen gas; the sulphur is converted into hydrogen\nsulphide, carbon disulphide, and oxides of sulphur; the oxygen into\nwater and oxides of carbon. The remaining hydrogen is set free partly\nas hydrogen and partly in combination with carbon in the form of\nhydrocarbons. The most important of these is methane, with smaller\nquantities of many others, some of which are liquids or solids at\nordinary temperatures. The great bulk of the carbon remains behind as\ncoke and retort carbon.",
  "~The manufacture of coal gas.~ In the manufacture of coal gas it is\nnecessary to separate from the volatile constituents formed by the\nheating of the coal all those substances which are either solid or\nliquid at ordinary temperature, since these would clog the gas pipes.\nCertain gaseous constituents, such as hydrogen sulphide and ammonia,\nmust also be removed. The method used to accomplish this is shown in\nFig. 66. The coal is heated in air-tight retorts illustrated by A. The\nvolatile products escape through the pipe X and bubble into the tarry\nliquid in the large pipe B, known as the _hydraulic main_, which runs\nat right angles to the retorts. Here is deposited the greater portion of\nthe solid and liquid products, forming a tarry mass known as _coal tar_.\nMuch of the ammonia also remains dissolved in this liquid. The partially\npurified gas then passes into the pipes C, which serve to cool it and\nfurther remove the solid and liquid matter. The gas then passes into\nD, which is filled with coke over which a jet of water is sprayed. The\nwater still further cools the gas and at the same time partially removes\nsuch gaseous products as hydrogen sulphide and ammonia, which are\nsoluble in water. In E the gas passes over some material such as lime,\nwhich removes the last portions of the sulphur compounds as well as much\nof the carbon dioxide present. From E the gas passes into the large\ngas holder F, from which it is distributed through pipes to the places\nwhere it is burned.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 66]",
  "One ton of good gas coal yields approximately 10,000 cu. ft. of\n     gas, 1400 lb. of coke, 120 lb. of tar, and 20 gal. of\n     ammoniacal liquor.",
  "Not only is the ammonia obtained in the manufacture of the gas\n     of great importance, but the coal tar also serves as the source\n     of many very useful substances, as will be explained in Chapter\n     XXXII.",
  "~Water gas.~ Water gas is essentially a mixture of carbon monoxide and\nhydrogen. It is made by passing steam over very hot anthracite coal,\nwhen the reaction shown in the following equation takes place:",
  "C + H_{2}O = CO + 2H.",
  "When required merely to produce heat the gas is at once ready for use.\nWhen made for illuminating purposes it must be enriched, that is,\nilluminants must be added, since both carbon monoxide and hydrogen burn\nwith non-luminous flames. This is accomplished by passing it into\nheaters containing highly heated petroleum oils. The gas takes up\nhydrocarbon gases formed in the decomposition of the petroleum oils,\nwhich make it burn with a luminous flame.",
  "Water gas is very effective as a fuel, since both carbon monoxide and\nhydrogen burn with very hot flames. It has little odor and is very\npoisonous. Its use is therefore attended with some risk, since leaks in\npipes are very likely to escape notice.",
  "~Natural gas.~ This substance, so abundant in many localities, varies much\nin composition, but is composed principally of methane. When used for\nlighting purposes it is usually burned in a burner resembling an open\nBunsen, the illumination being furnished by an incandescent mantle. This\nis the case in the familiar Welsbach burner. Contrary to statements\nfrequently made, natural gas contains no free hydrogen.",

Since these fuels\nare composed principally of carbon and hydrogen or their compounds, the\nchief products of combustion are carbon dioxide and water.

  "1. _Arc furnaces._ In the one type the source of heat is an electric arc\nformed between carbon electrodes separated a little from each other, as\nshown in Fig. 67.

The electrodes and\ncrucible are surrounded by materials which fuse with great difficulty,\nsuch as magnesium oxide, the walls of the furnace being so shaped as to\nreflect the heat downwards upon the contents of the crucible.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 68]",
  "2. _Resistance furnaces._ In the other type of furnace the heat is\ngenerated by the resistance offered to the current in its passage\nthrough the furnace.

The furnace is merely a rectangular box built up of loose bricks.\nThe electrodes E, each consisting of a bundle of carbon rods, are\nintroduced through the sides of the furnace. The materials to be heated,\nC, are filled into the furnace up to the electrodes, and a layer of\nbroken coke is arranged so as to extend from one electrode to the other.\nMore of the charge is then placed on top of the coke.

  "CHAPTER XIX",
  "MOLECULAR WEIGHTS, ATOMIC WEIGHTS, FORMULAS",
  "~Introduction.~ In the chapter on The Atomic Theory, it was shown that if\nit were true that two elements uniting to form a compound always\ncombined in the ratio of one atom of one element to one atom of the\nother element, it would be a very easy matter to decide upon figures\nwhich would represent the relative weights of the different atoms. It\nwould only be necessary to select some one element as a standard and\ndetermine the weight of every element which combines with a definite\nweight (say 1 g.) of the standard element. The figures so obtained would\nevidently represent the relative weights of the atoms.",
  "But the law of multiple proportion at once reminds us that two elements\nmay unite in several proportions; and there is no simple way to\ndetermine the number of atoms present in the molecule of any compound.\nConsequently the problem of deciding upon the relative atomic weights is\nnot an easy one. To the solution of this problem we must now turn.",
  "~Dalton's method of determining atomic weights.~ When Dalton first\nadvanced the atomic theory he attempted to solve this problem by very\nsimple methods. He thought that when only one compound of two elements\nis known it is reasonable to suppose that it contains one atom of each\nelement. He therefore gave the formula HO to water, and HN to ammonia.\nWhen more than two compounds were known he assumed that the most\nfamiliar or the most stable one had the simple formula. He then\ndetermined the atomic weight as explained above. The results he\nobtained were contradictory and very far from satisfactory, and it was\nsoon seen that some other method, resting on much more scientific\ngrounds, must be found to decide what compounds, if any, have a single\natom of each element present.",
  "~Determination of atomic weights.~ Three distinct steps are involved in\nthe determination of the atomic weight of an element: (1) determination\nof the equivalent, (2) determination of molecular weights of its\ncompounds, and (3) deduction of the exact atomic weight from the\nequivalent and molecular weights.",
  "~1. Determination of the equivalent.~ By the equivalent of an element is\nmeant the weight of the element which will combine with a fixed weight\nof some other element chosen as a standard. It has already been\nexplained that oxygen has been selected as the standard element for\natomic weights, with a weight of 16. This same standard will serve very\nwell as a standard for equivalents. _The equivalent of an element is the\nweight of the element which will combine with 16 g. of oxygen._ Thus 16\ng. of oxygen combines with 16.03 g. of sulphur, 65.4 g. of zinc, 215.86\ng. of silver, 70.9 g. of chlorine. These figures, therefore, represent\nthe equivalent weights of these elements.",
  "~Relation of atomic weights to equivalents.~ According to the atomic\ntheory combination always takes place between whole numbers of atoms.\nThus one atom unites with one other, or with two or three; or two atoms\nmay unite with three, or three with five, and so on.",
  "When oxygen combines with zinc the combination must be between definite\nnumbers of the two kinds of atoms. Experiment shows that these two\nelements combine in the ratio of 16 g. of oxygen to 65.4 g. of zinc. If\none atom of oxygen combines with one atom of zinc, then this ratio must\nbe the ratio between the weights of the two atoms. If one atom of oxygen\ncombines with two atoms of zinc, then the ratio between the weights of\nthe two atoms will be 16: 32.7. If two atoms of oxygen combine with one\natom of zinc, the ratio by weight between the two atoms will be 8: 65.4.\nIt is evident, therefore, that the real atomic weight of an element must\nbe some multiple or submultiple of the equivalent; in other words, the\nequivalent multiplied by 1/2, 1, 2, or 3 will give the atomic weight.",
  "~Combining weights.~ A very interesting relation holds good between the\nequivalents of the various elements. We have just seen that the figures\n16.03, 65.4, 215.86, and 70.9 are the equivalents respectively of\nsulphur, zinc, silver, and chlorine. These same figures represent the\nratios by weight in which these elements combine among themselves. Thus\n215.86 g. of silver combine with 70.9 g. of chlorine and with 2 × 16.03\ng. of sulphur. 65.4 g. of zinc combine with 70.9 g. of chlorine and 2 ×\n16.03 g. of sulphur.",
  "By taking the equivalent or some multiple of it a value can be obtained\nfor each element which will represent its combining value, and for this\nreason is called its _combining weight_. It is important to notice that\nthe fact that a combining weight can be obtained for each element is not\na part of a theory, but is the direct result of experiment.",
  "~Elements with more than one equivalent.~ It will be remembered that\noxygen combines with hydrogen in two ratios. In one case 16 g. of oxygen\ncombine with 2.016 g. of hydrogen to form water; in the other 16 g. of\noxygen combine with 1.008 g. of hydrogen to form hydrogen dioxide. The\nequivalents of hydrogen are therefore 2.016 and 1.008. Barium combines\nwith oxygen in two proportions: in barium oxide the proportion is 16 g.\nof oxygen to 137.4 g. of barium; in barium dioxide the proportion is 16\ng. of oxygen to 68.7 g. of barium.",
  "In each case one equivalent is a simple multiple of the other, so the\nfact that there may be two equivalents does not add to the uncertainty.\nAll we knew before was that the true atomic weight is some multiple of\nthe equivalent.",
  "~2. The determination of molecular weights.~ To decide the question as to\nwhich multiple of the equivalent correctly represents the atomic weight\nof an element, it has been found necessary to devise a method of\ndetermining the molecular weights of compounds containing the element in\nquestion. Since the molecular weight of a compound is merely the sum of\nthe weights of all the atoms present in it, it would seem to be\nimpossible to determine the molecular weight of a compound without first\nknowing the atomic weights of the constituent atoms, and how many atoms\nof each element are present in the molecule. But certain facts have been\ndiscovered which suggest a way in which this can be done.",
  "~Avogadro's hypothesis.~ We have seen that the laws of Boyle, Charles, and\nGay-Lussac apply to all gases irrespective of their chemical character.\nThis would lead to the inference that the structure of gases must be\nquite simple, and that it is much the same in all gases.",
  "In 1811 Avogadro, an Italian physicist, suggested that if we assume all\ngases under the same conditions of temperature and pressure to have the\nsame number of molecules in a given volume, we shall have a probable\nexplanation of the simplicity of the gas laws. It is difficult to prove\nthe truth of this hypothesis by a simple experiment, but there are so\nmany facts known which are in complete harmony with this suggestion that\nthere is little doubt that it expresses the truth. Avogadro's hypothesis\nmay be stated thus: _Equal volumes of all gases under the same\nconditions of temperature and pressure contain the same number of\nmolecules._",
  "~Avogadro's hypothesis and molecular weights.~ Assuming that Avogadro's\nhypothesis is correct, we have a very simple means for deciding upon the\nrelative weights of molecules; for if equal volumes of two gases contain\nthe same number of molecules, the weights of the two volumes must be in\nthe same ratio as the weights of the individual molecules which they\ncontain. If we adopt some one gas as a standard, we can express the\nweights of all other gases as compared with this one, and the same\nfigures will express the relative weights of the molecules of which the\ngases are composed.",
  "~Oxygen as the standard.~ It is important that the same standard should be\nadopted for the determination of molecular weights as has been decided\nupon for atomic weights and equivalents, so that the three values may be\nin harmony with each other. Accordingly it is best to adopt oxygen as\nthe standard element with which to compare the molecular weights of\nother gases, being careful to keep the oxygen atom equal to 16.",
  "~The oxygen molecule contains two atoms.~ One point must not be\noverlooked, however. We desire to have our unit, the oxygen _atom_,\nequal to 16. The method of comparing the weights of gases just suggested\ncompares the molecules of the gases with the _molecule_ of oxygen. Is\nthe molecule and the atom of oxygen the same thing? This question is\nanswered by the following considerations.",
  "We have seen that when steam is formed by the union of oxygen and\nhydrogen, two volumes of hydrogen combine with one volume of oxygen to\nform two volumes of steam. Let us suppose that the one volume of oxygen\ncontains 100 molecules; then the two volumes of steam must, according\nto Avogadro's hypothesis, contain 200 molecules. But each of these 200\nmolecules must contain at least one atom of oxygen, or 200 in all, and\nthese 200 atoms came from 100 molecules of oxygen. It follows that each\nmolecule of oxygen must contain at least two atoms of oxygen.",
  "Evidently this reasoning merely shows that there are _at least_ two\natoms in the oxygen molecule. There may be more than that, but as there\nis no evidence to this effect, we assume that the molecule contains two\natoms only.",
  "It is evident that if we wish to retain the value 16 for the atom of\noxygen we must take twice this value, or 32, for the value of the oxygen\nmolecule, when using it as a standard for molecular weights.",
  "~Determination of the molecular weights of gases from their weights\ncompared with oxygen.~ Assuming the molecular weight of oxygen to be 32,\nAvogadro's hypothesis gives us a ready means for determining the\nmolecular weight of any other gas, for all that is required is to know\nits weight compared with that of an equal volume of oxygen. For example,\n1 l. of chlorine is found by experiment to weigh 2.216 times as much as\n1 l. of oxygen. The molecular weight of chlorine must therefore be 2.216\n× 32, or 70.91.",
  "If, instead of comparing the relative weights of 1 l. of the two gases,\nwe select such a volume of oxygen as will weigh 32 g., or the weight in\ngrams corresponding to the molecular weight of the gas, the calculation\nis much simplified. It has been found that 32 g. of oxygen, under\nstandard conditions, measure 22.4 l. This same volume of hydrogen weighs\n2.019 g.; of chlorine 70.9 g.; of hydrochloric acid 36.458 g. The\nweights of these equal volumes must be proportional to their molecular\nweights, and since the weight of the oxygen is the same as the value of\nits molecular weight, so too will the weights of the 22.4 l. of the\nother gases be equal to the value of their molecular weights.",
  "As a summary we can then make the following statement: _The molecular\nweight of any gas may be determined by calculating the weight of 22.4 l.\nof the gas, measured under standard conditions._",
  "~Determination of molecular weights from density of gases.~ In an actual\nexperiment it is easier to determine the density of a gas than the\nweight of a definite volume of it. The density of a gas is usually\ndefined as its weight compared with that of an equal volume of air.\nHaving determined the density of a gas, its weight compared with oxygen\nmay be determined by multiplying its density by the ratio between the\nweights of air and oxygen. This ratio is 0.9046. To compare it with our\nstandard for atomic weights we must further multiply it by 32, since the\nstandard is 1/32 the weight of oxygen molecules. The steps then are\nthese:",
  "1. Determine the density of the gas (its weight compared with air).",
  "2. Multiply by 0.9046 to make the comparison with oxygen molecules.",
  "3. Multiply by 32 to make the comparison with the unit for atomic\nweights.",
  "We have, then, the formula:",
  "molecular weight = density × 0.9046 × 32;",
  "or, still more briefly,",
  "M. = D. × 28.9.",
  "The value found by this method for the determination of molecular\nweights will of course agree with those found by calculating the weight\nof 22.4 l. of the gas, since both methods depend on the same principles.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 69]",
  "~Determination of densities of gases.~ The relative weights of\n     equal volumes of two gases can be easily determined. The\n     following is one of the methods used. A small flask, such as is\n     shown in Fig. 69, is filled with one of the gases, and after\n     the temperature and pressure have been noted the flask is\n     sealed up and weighed. The tip of the sealed end is then broken\n     off, the flask filled with the second gas, and its weight\n     determined. If the weight of the empty flask is subtracted from\n     these two weighings, the relative weights of the gases is\n     readily found.",
  "~3. Deduction of atomic weights from molecular weights and equivalents.~\nWe have now seen how the equivalent of an element and the molecular\nweight of compounds containing the element can be obtained. Let us see\nhow it is possible to decide which multiple of the equivalent really is\nthe true atomic weight. As an example, let us suppose that the\nequivalent of nitrogen has been found to be 7.02 and that it is desired\nto obtain its atomic weight. The next step is to obtain the molecular\nweights of a large number of compounds containing nitrogen. The\nfollowing will serve:",

  "If a large number of compounds containing nitrogen are studied in this\nway, it is probable that there will be included in the list at least one\nsubstance whose molecule contains a single nitrogen atom.

  "~Molecular weights of the elements.~ It will be noticed that the molecular\nweight of nitrogen obtained by multiplying its density by 28.9 is 28.08.\nYet the atomic weight of nitrogen as deduced from a study of its gaseous\ncompounds is 14.04. The simplest explanation that can be given for this\nis that the gaseous nitrogen is made up of molecules, each of which\ncontains two atoms. In this respect it resembles oxygen; for we have\nseen that an entirely different line of reasoning leads us to believe\nthat the molecule of oxygen contains two atoms.

  "This law is not very accurate, but it is often possible by means of it\nto decide upon what multiple of the equivalent is the real atomic\nweight. Thus the specific heat of iron is found by experiment to be\n0.112, and its equivalent is 27.95. 6.25 ÷ 0.112 = 55.8. We see,\ntherefore, that the atomic weight is twice the equivalent, or 55.9.",
  "~How formulas are determined.~ It will be well in connection with\nmolecular weights to consider how the formula of a compound is decided\nupon, for the two subjects are very closely associated. Some examples\nwill make clear the method followed.",
  "The molecular weight of a substance containing hydrogen and chlorine was\n36.4. By analysis 36.4 parts of the substance was found to contain 1\npart of hydrogen and 35.4 parts of chlorine. As these are the simple\natomic weights of the two elements, the formula of the compound must be\nHCl.",
  "A substance consisting of oxygen and hydrogen was found to have a\nmolecular weight of 34. Analysis showed that in 34 parts of the\nsubstance there were 2 parts of hydrogen and 32 parts of oxygen.\nDividing these figures by the atomic weights of the two elements, we get\n2 ÷ 1 = 2 for H; 32 ÷ 16 = 2 for O. The formula is therefore H_{2}O_{2}.",
  "A substance containing 2.04% H, 32.6% S, and 65.3% O was found to have a\nmolecular weight of 98. In these 98 parts of the substance there are 98\n× 2.04% = 2 parts of H, 98 × 32.6% = 32 parts of S, and 98 × 65.3% = 64\nparts of O. If the molecule weighs 98, the hydrogen atoms present must\ntogether weigh 2, the sulphur atoms 32, and the oxygen atoms 64.\nDividing these figures by the respective atomic weights of the three\nelements, we have, for H, 2 ÷ 1 = 2 atoms; for S, 32 ÷ 32 = 1 atom; for\nO, 64 ÷ 16 = 4 atoms. Hence the formula is H_{2}SO_{4}.",
  "We have, then, this general procedure: Find the percentage composition\nof the substance and also its molecular weight. Multiply the molecular\nweight successively by the percentage of each element present, to find\nthe amount of the element in the molecular weight of the compound. The\nfigures so obtained will be the respective parts of the molecular weight\ndue to the several atoms. Divide by the atomic weights of the respective\nelements, and the quotient will be the number of atoms present.",

  "~History.~ The element phosphorus was discovered by the alchemist Brand,\nof Hamburg, in 1669, while searching for the philosopher's stone. Owing\nto its peculiar properties and the secrecy which was maintained about\nits preparation, it remained a very rare and costly substance until the\ndemand for it in the manufacture of matches brought about its production\non a large scale.",
  "~Occurrence.~ Owing to its great chemical activity phosphorus never occurs\nfree in nature. In the form of phosphates it is very abundant and widely\ndistributed. _Phosphorite_ and _sombrerite_ are mineral forms of calcium\nphosphate, while _apatite_ consists of calcium phosphate together with\ncalcium fluoride or chloride. These minerals form very large deposits\nand are extensively mined for use as fertilizers. Calcium phosphate is a\nconstituent of all fertile soil, having been supplied to the soil by the\ndisintegration of rocks containing it. It is the chief mineral\nconstituent of bones of animals, and bone ash is therefore nearly pure\ncalcium phosphate.",
  "~Preparation.~ Phosphorus is now manufactured from bone ash or a pure\nmineral phosphate by heating the phosphate with sand and carbon in an\nelectric furnace. The materials are fed in at M (Fig. 70) by the feed\nscrew F. The phosphorus vapor escapes at P and is condensed under\nwater, while the calcium silicate is tapped off as a liquid at S. The\nphosphorus obtained in this way is quite impure, and is purified by\ndistillation.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 70]",
  "~Explanation of the reaction.~ To understand the reaction which\n     occurs, it must be remembered that a volatile acid anhydride is\n     expelled from its salts when heated with an anhydride which is\n     not volatile. Thus, when sodium carbonate and silicon dioxide\n     are heated together the following reaction takes place:",
  "Na_{2}CO_{3} + SiO_{2} = Na_{2}SiO_{3} + CO_{2}.",
  "Silicon dioxide is a less volatile anhydride than phosphoric\n     anhydride (P_{2}O_{5}), and when strongly heated with a\n     phosphate the phosphoric anhydride is driven out, thus:",
  "Ca_{3}(PO_{4})_{2} + 3SiO_{2} = 3CaSiO_{3} + P_{2}O_{5}.",
  "If carbon is added before the heat is applied, the P_{2}O_{5}\n     is reduced to phosphorus at the same time, according to the\n     equation",
  "P_{2}O_{5} + 5C = 2P + 5CO.",
  "~Physical properties.~ The purified phosphorus is a pale yellowish,\ntranslucent, waxy solid which melts at 43.3° and boils at 269°. It can\ntherefore be cast into any convenient form under warm water, and is\nusually sold in the market in the form of sticks. It is quite soft and\ncan be easily cut with a knife, but this must always be done while the\nelement is covered with water, since it is extremely inflammable, and\nthe friction of the knife blade is almost sure to set it on fire if cut\nin the air. It is not soluble in water, but is freely soluble in some\nother liquids, notably in carbon disulphide. Its density is 1.8.",
  "~Chemical properties.~ Exposed to the air phosphorus slowly combines with\noxygen, and in so doing emits a pale light, or phosphorescence, which\ncan be seen only in a dark place. The heat of the room may easily raise\nthe temperature to the kindling point of phosphorus, when it burns with\na sputtering flame, giving off dense fumes of oxide of phosphorus. It\nburns with dazzling brilliancy in oxygen, and combines directly with\nmany other elements, especially with sulphur and the halogens. On\naccount of its great affinity for oxygen it is always preserved under\nwater.",
  "Phosphorus is very poisonous, from 0.2 to 0.3 gram being a fatal dose.\nGround up with flour and water or similar substances, it is often used\nas a poison for rats and other vermin.",
  "~Precaution.~ The heat of the body is sufficient to raise\n     phosphorus above its kindling temperature, and for this reason\n     it should always be handled with forceps and never with the\n     bare fingers. Burns occasioned by it are very painful and slow\n     in healing.",
  "~Red phosphorus.~ On standing, yellow phosphorus gradually undergoes a\nremarkable change, being converted into a dark red powder which has a\ndensity of 2.1. It no longer takes fire easily, neither does it dissolve\nin carbon disulphide. It is not poisonous and, in fact, seems to be an\nentirely different substance. The velocity of this change increases with\nrise in temperature, and the red phosphorus is therefore prepared by\nheating the yellow just below the boiling point (250°-300°). When\ndistilled and quickly condensed the red form changes back to the yellow.\nThis is in accordance with the general rule that when a substance\ncapable of existing in several allotropic forms is condensed from a gas\nor crystallized from the liquid state, the more unstable variety forms\nfirst, and this then passes into the more stable forms.",
  "~Matches.~ The chief use of phosphorus is in the manufacture of\n     matches. Common matches are made by first dipping the match\n     sticks into some inflammable substance, such as melted\n     paraffin, and afterward into a paste consisting of (1)\n     phosphorus, (2) some oxidizing substance, such as manganese\n     dioxide or potassium chlorate, and (3) a binding material,\n     usually some kind of glue. On friction the phosphorus is\n     ignited, the combustion being sustained by the oxidizing agent\n     and communicated to the wood by the burning paraffin. In\n     sulphur matches the paraffin is replaced by sulphur.",
  "In safety matches _red_ phosphorus, an oxidizing agent, and\n     some gritty material such as emery is placed on the side of the\n     box, while the match tip is provided as before with an\n     oxidizing agent and an easily oxidized substance, usually\n     antimony sulphide. The match cannot be ignited easily by\n     friction, save on the prepared surface.",
  "~Compounds of phosphorus with hydrogen.~ Phosphorus forms several\ncompounds with hydrogen, the best known of which is phosphine (PH_{3})\nanalogous to ammonia (NH_{3}).",
  "~Preparation of phosphine.~ Phosphine is usually made by heating\nphosphorus with a strong solution of potassium hydroxide, the reaction\nbeing a complicated one.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 71]",
  "The experiment can be conveniently made in the apparatus shown\n     in Fig. 71. A strong solution of potassium hydroxide together\n     with several small bits of phosphorus are placed in the flask\n     A, and a current of coal gas is passed into the flask through\n     the tube B until all the air has been displaced. The gas is\n     then turned off and the flask is heated. Phosphine is formed in\n     small quantities and escapes through the delivery tube, the\n     exit of which is just covered by the water in the vessel C.\n     Each bubble of the gas as it escapes into the air takes fire,\n     and the product of combustion (P_{2}O_{5}) forms beautiful\n     small rings, which float unbroken for a considerable time in\n     quiet air. The pure phosphine does not take fire spontaneously.\n     When prepared as directed above, impurities are present which\n     impart this property.",
  "~Properties.~ Phosphine is a gas of unpleasant odor and is exceedingly\npoisonous. Like ammonia it forms salts with the halogen acids. Thus we\nhave phosphonium chloride (PH_{4}Cl) analogous to ammonium chloride\n(NH_{4}Cl). The phosphonium salts are of but little importance.",
  "~Oxides of phosphorus.~ Phosphorus forms two well-known oxides,--the\ntrioxide (P_{2}O_{3}) and the pentoxide (P_{2}O_{5}), sometimes called\nphosphoric anhydride. When phosphorus burns in an insufficient supply of\nair the product is partially the trioxide; in oxygen or an excess of air\nthe pentoxide is formed. The pentoxide is much the better known of the\ntwo. It is a snow-white, voluminous powder whose most marked property is\nits great attraction for water. It has no chemical action upon most\ngases, so that they can be very thoroughly dried by allowing them to\npass through properly arranged vessels containing phosphorus pentoxide.",
  "~Acids of phosphorus.~ The important acids of phosphorus are the\nfollowing:",
  "H_{3}PO_{3}       phosphorous acid.\n    H_{3}PO_{4}       phosphoric acid.\n    H_{4}P_{2}O_{7}   pyrophosphoric acid.\n    HPO_{3}           metaphosphoric acid.",
  "These may be regarded as combinations of the oxides of phosphorus with\nwater according to the equations given in the discussion of the\ncharacteristics of the family.",
  "1. _Phosphorous acid_ (H_{3}PO_{3}). Neither the acid nor its salts are\nat all frequently met with in chemical operations. It can be easily\nobtained, however, in the form of transparent crystals when phosphorus\ntrichloride is treated with water and the resulting solution is\nevaporated:",
  "PCl_{3} + 3H_{2}O = H_{3}PO_{3} + 3HCl.",
  "Its most interesting property is its tendency to take up oxygen and pass\nover into phosphoric acid.",
  "2. _Orthophosphoric acid (phosphoric acid)_ (H_{3}PO_{4}). This acid can\nbe obtained by dissolving phosphorus pentoxide in boiling water, as\nrepresented in the equation",
  "P_{2}O_{5} + 3H_{2}O = 2H_{3}PO_{4}.",
  "It is usually made by treating calcium phosphate with concentrated\nsulphuric acid. The calcium sulphate produced in the reaction is nearly\ninsoluble, and can be filtered off, leaving the phosphoric acid in\nsolution. Very pure acid is made by oxidizing phosphorus with nitric\nacid. It forms large colorless crystals which are exceedingly soluble in\nwater. Being a tribasic acid, it forms acid as well as normal salts.\nThus the following compounds of sodium are known:",
  "NaH_{2}PO_{4}   monosodium hydrogen phosphate.\n    Na_{2}HPO_{4}   disodium hydrogen phosphate.\n    Na_{3}PO_{4}    normal sodium phosphate.",
  "These salts are sometimes called respectively primary, secondary, and\ntertiary phosphates. They may be prepared by bringing together\nphosphoric acid and appropriate quantities of sodium hydroxide.\nPhosphoric acid also forms mixed salts, that is, salts containing two\ndifferent metals. The most familiar compound of this kind is microcosmic\nsalt, which has the formula Na(NH_{4})HPO_{4}.",
  "_Orthophosphates._ The orthophosphates form an important class of salts.\nThe normal salts are nearly all insoluble and many of them occur in\nnature. The secondary phosphates are as a rule insoluble, while most of\nthe primary salts are soluble.",
  "3. _Pyrophosphoric acid_ (H_{4}P_{2}O_{7}). On heating orthophosphoric\nacid to about 225° pyrophosphoric acid is formed in accordance with the\nfollowing equation:",
  "2H_{3}PO_{4} = H_{4}P_{2}O_{7} + H_{2}O.",
  "It is a white crystalline solid. Its salts can be prepared by heating a\nsecondary phosphate:",
  "2Na_{2}HPO_{4} = Na_{4}P_{2}O_{7} + H_{2}O.",
  "4. _Metaphosphoric acid (glacial phosphoric acid)_ (HPO_{3}). This acid\nis formed when orthophosphoric acid is heated above 400°:",
  "H_{3}PO_{4} = HPO_{3} + H_{2}O.",
  "It is also formed when phosphorus pentoxide is treated with cold water:",
  "P_{2}O_{5} + H_{2}O = 2HPO_{3}.",
  "It is a white crystalline solid, and is so stable towards heat that it\ncan be fused and even volatilized without decomposition. On cooling from\nthe fused state it forms a glassy solid, and on this account is often\ncalled glacial phosphoric acid. It possesses the property of dissolving\nsmall quantities of metallic oxides, with the formation of compounds\nwhich, in the case of certain metals, have characteristic colors. It is\ntherefore used in the detection of these metals.",
  "While the secondary phosphates, on heating, give salts of pyrophosphoric\nacid, the primary phosphates yield salts of metaphosphoric acid. The\nequations representing these reactions are as follows:",
  "2Na_{2}HPO_{4} = Na_{4}P_{3}O_{7} + H_{2}O,",
  "NaH_{2}PO_{4} = NaPO_{3} + H_{2}O.",
  "~Fertilizers.~ When crops are produced year after year on the same field\ncertain constituents of the soil essential to plant growth are removed,\nand the soil becomes impoverished and unproductive. To make the land\nonce more fertile these constituents must be replaced. The calcium\nphosphate of the mineral deposits or of bone ash serves well as a\nmaterial for restoring phosphorus to soils exhausted of that essential\nelement; but a more soluble substance, which the plants can more readily\nassimilate, is desirable. It is better, therefore, to convert the\ninsoluble calcium phosphate into the soluble primary phosphate before it\nis applied as fertilizer. It will be seen by reference to the formulas\nfor the orthophosphates (see page 244) that in a primary phosphate only\none hydrogen atom of phosphoric acid is replaced by a metal. Since the\ncalcium atom always replaces two hydrogen atoms, it might be thought\nthat there could be no primary calcium phosphate; but if the calcium\natom replaces one hydrogen atom from each of two molecules of phosphoric\nacid, the salt Ca(H_{2}PO_{4})_{2} will result, and this is a primary\nphosphate. It can be made by treatment of the normal phosphate with the\nnecessary amount of sulphuric acid, calcium sulphate being formed at the\nsame time, thus:",

  "2As_{2}O_{3} + 3C = 4As + 3CO_{2}.",
  "~Properties.~ Arsenic is a steel-gray, metallic-looking substance of\ndensity 5.73. Though resembling metals in appearance, it is quite\nbrittle, being easily powdered in a mortar. When strongly heated it\nsublimes, that is, it passes into a vapor without melting, and condenses\nagain to a crystalline solid when the vapor is cooled. Like phosphorus\nit can be obtained in several allotropic forms. It alloys readily with\nsome of the metals, and finds its chief use as an alloy with lead, which\nis used for making shot, the alloy being harder than pure lead.

  "[Illustration: Fig. 72]",
  "~Marsh's test for arsenic.~ The method devised by Marsh for\n     detecting arsenic is most frequently used, the apparatus being\n     shown in Fig. 72. Hydrogen is generated in the flask A by the\n     action of dilute sulphuric acid on zinc, is dried by passing\n     over calcium chloride in the tube B, and after passing\n     through the hard-glass tube C is ignited at the jet D. If a\n     substance containing arsenic is now introduced into the\n     generator A, the arsenic is converted into arsine by the\n     action of the nascent hydrogen, and passes to the jet along\n     with the hydrogen. If the tube C is strongly heated at some\n     point near the middle, the arsine is decomposed while passing\n     this point and the arsenic is deposited just beyond the heated\n     point in the form of a shining, brownish-black mirror. If the\n     tube is not heated, the arsine burns along with the hydrogen at\n     the jet. Under these conditions a small porcelain dish crowded\n     down into the flame is blackened by a spot of metallic arsenic,\n     for the arsine is decomposed by the heat of the flame, and the\n     arsenic, cooled below its kindling temperature by the cold\n     porcelain, deposits upon it as a black spot. Antimony conducts\n     itself in the same way as arsenic, but the antimony deposit is\n     more sooty in appearance. The two can also be distinguished by\n     the fact that sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) dissolves the arsenic\n     deposit, but not that formed by antimony.",

Of these arsenious\noxide, or arsenic trioxide (As_{2}O_{3}), is much better known, and is\nthe substance usually called white arsenic, or merely arsenic. It is\nfound as a mineral, but is usually obtained as a by-product in burning\npyrite in the sulphuric-acid industry.

  "2H_{3}AsO_{3} = As_{2}O_{3} + 3H_{2}O.",
  "Salts of all the acids are known, however, and some of them have\ncommercial value. Most of them are insoluble, and some of the copper\nsalts, which are green, are used as pigments. Paris green, which has a\ncomplicated formula, is a well-known insecticide.",
  "~Antidote for arsenical poisoning.~ The most efficient antidote for\narsenic poisoning is ferric hydroxide. It is prepared as needed,\naccording to the equation",
  "Fe_{2}(SO_{4})_{3} + 3Mg(OH)_{2} = 2Fe(OH)_{3} + 3MgSO_{4}.",
  "~Sulphides of arsenic.~ When hydrogen sulphide is passed into an acidified\nsolution containing an arsenic compound the arsenic is precipitated as a\nbright yellow sulphide, thus:",
  "2H_{3}AsO_{3} + 3H_{2}S = As_{2}S_{3} + 6H_{2}O,",
  "2H_{3}AsO_{4} + 5H_{2}S = As_{2}S_{5} + 8H_{2}O.",
  "In this respect arsenic resembles the metallic elements, many of which\nproduce sulphides under similar conditions. The sulphides of arsenic,\nboth those produced artificially and those found in nature, are used as\nyellow pigments.",
  "ANTIMONY",
  "~Occurrence.~ Antimony occurs in nature chiefly as the sulphide\n(Sb_{2}S_{3}), called stibnite, though it is also found as oxide and as\na constituent of many complex minerals.",
  "~Preparation.~ Antimony is prepared from the sulphide in a very simple\nmanner. The sulphide is melted with scrap iron in a furnace, when the\niron combines with the sulphur to form a slag, or liquid layer of melted\niron sulphide, while the heavier liquid, antimony, settles to the bottom\nand is drawn off from time to time. The reaction involved is represented\nby the equation",
  "Sb_{2}S_{3} + 3Fe = 2Sb + 3FeS.",
  "~Physical properties.~ Antimony is a bluish-white, metallic-looking\nsubstance whose density is 6.7. It is highly crystalline, hard, and very\nbrittle. It has a rather low melting point (432°) and expands very\nnoticeably on solidifying.",
  "~Chemical properties.~ In chemical properties antimony resembles arsenic\nin many particulars. It forms the oxides Sb_{2}O_{3} and Sb_{2}O_{5},\nand in addition Sb_{2}O_{4}. It combines with the halogen elements with\ngreat energy, burning brilliantly in chlorine to form antimony\ntrichloride (SbCl_{3}). When heated on charcoal with the blowpipe it is\noxidized and forms a coating of antimony oxide on the charcoal which has\na characteristic bluish-white color.",
  "~Stibine~ (SbH_{3}). The gas stibine (SbH_{3}) is formed under conditions\nwhich are very similar to those which produce arsine, and it closely\nresembles the latter compound, though it is still less stable. It is\nvery poisonous.",
  "~Acids of antimony.~ The oxides Sb_{2}O_{3} and Sb_{2}O_{5} are\n     weak acid anhydrides and are capable of forming two series of\n     acids corresponding in formulas to the acids of phosphorus and\n     arsenic. They are much weaker, however, and are of little\n     practical importance.",
  "~Sulphides of antimony.~ Antimony resembles arsenic in that\n     hydrogen sulphide precipitates it as a sulphide when conducted\n     into an acidified solution containing an antimony compound:",
  "2SbCl_{3} + 3H_{2}S = Sb_{2}S_{3} + 6HCl,",
  "2SbCl_{5} + 5H_{2}S = Sb_{2}S_{5} + 10HCl.",
  "The two sulphides of antimony are called the trisulphide and\n     the pentasulphide respectively. When prepared in this way they\n     are orange-colored substances, though the mineral stibnite is\n     black.",
  "~Metallic properties of antimony.~ The physical properties of the element\nare those of a metal, and the fact that its sulphide is precipitated by\nhydrogen sulphide shows that it acts like a metal in a chemical way.\nMany other reactions show that antimony has more of the properties of a\nmetal than of a non-metal. The compound Sb(OH)_{3}, corresponding to\narsenious acid, while able to act as a weak acid is also able to act as\na weak base with strong acids. For example, when treated with\nconcentrated hydrochloric acid antimony chloride is formed:",
  "Sb(OH)_{3} + 3HCl = SbCl_{3} + 3H_{2}O.",
  "A number of elements act in this same way, their hydroxides under some\nconditions being weak acids and under others weak bases.",
  "ALLOYS",
  "Some metals when melted together thoroughly intermix, and on cooling\nform a homogeneous, metallic-appearing substance called an _alloy_. Not\nall metals will mix in this way, and in some cases definite chemical\ncompounds are formed and separate out as the mixture solidifies, thus\ndestroying the uniform quality of the alloy. In general the melting\npoint of the alloy is below the average of the melting points of its\nconstituents, and it is often lower than any one of them.",
  "Antimony forms alloys with many of the metals, and its chief commercial\nuse is for such purposes. It imparts to its alloys high density, rather\nlow melting point, and the property of expanding on solidification.\nSuch an alloy is especially useful in type founding, where fine lines\nare to be reproduced on a cast. Type metal consists of antimony, lead,\nand tin. Babbitt metal, used for journal bearings in machinery, contains\nthe same metals in a different proportion together with a small\npercentage of copper.",
  "BISMUTH",
  "~Occurrence.~ Bismuth is usually found in the uncombined form in nature.\nIt also occurs as oxide and sulphide. Most of the bismuth of commerce\ncomes from Saxony, and from Mexico and Colorado, but it is not an\nabundant element.",
  "~Preparation.~ It is prepared by merely heating the ore containing the\nnative bismuth and allowing the melted metal to run out into suitable\nvessels. Other ores are converted into oxides and reduced by heating\nwith carbon.",
  "~Physical properties.~ Bismuth is a heavy, crystalline, brittle metal\nnearly the color of silver, but with a slightly rosy tint which\ndistinguishes it from other metals. It melts at a low temperature (270°)\nand has a density of 9.8. It is not acted upon by the air at ordinary\ntemperatures.",
  "~Chemical properties.~ When heated with the blowpipe on charcoal, bismuth\ngives a coating of the oxide Bi_{2}O_{3}. This has a yellowish-brown\ncolor which easily distinguishes it from the oxides formed by other\nmetals. It combines very readily with the halogen elements, powdered\nbismuth burning readily in chlorine. It is not very easily acted upon by\nhydrochloric acid, but nitric and sulphuric acids act upon it in the\nsame way that they do upon copper.",
  "~Uses.~ Bismuth finds its chief use as a constituent of alloys,\nparticularly in those of low melting point. Some of these melt in hot\nwater. For example, Wood's metal, consisting of bismuth, lead, tin, and\ncadmium, melts at 60.5°.",
  "~Compounds of bismuth.~ Unlike the other elements of this group, bismuth\nhas almost no acid properties. Its chief oxide, Bi_{2}O_{3}, is basic in\nits properties. It dissolves in strong acids and forms salts of bismuth:",
  "Bi_{2}O_{3} + 6HCl = 2BiCl_{3} + 3H_{2}O,",
  "Bi_{2}O_{3} + 6HNO_{3} = 2Bi(NO_{3})_{3} + 3H_{2}O.",
  "The nitrate and chloride of bismuth can be obtained as well-formed\ncolorless crystals. When treated with water the salts are decomposed in\nthe manner explained in the following paragraph.",
  "HYDROLYSIS",
  "Many salts such as those of antimony and bismuth form solutions which\nare somewhat acid in reaction, and must therefore contain hydrogen ions.\nThis is accounted for by the same principle suggested to explain the\nfact that solutions of potassium cyanide are alkaline in reaction (p.\n210). Water forms an appreciable number of hydrogen and hydroxyl ions,\nand very weak bases such as bismuth hydroxide are dissociated to but a\nvery slight extent. When Bi^{+++} ions from bismuth chloride, which\ndissociates very readily, are brought in contact with the OH^{-} ions\nfrom water, the two come to the equilibrium expressed in the equation",
  "Bi^{+++} + 3OH^{-} <--> Bi(OH)_{3}.",
  "For every hydroxyl ion removed from the solution in this way a hydrogen\nion is left free, and the solution becomes acid in reaction.",
  "Reactions of this kind and that described under potassium cyanide are\ncalled _hydrolysis_.",
  "DEFINITION: _Hydrolysis is the action of water upon a salt to form an\nacid and a base, one of which is very slightly dissociated._",
  "~Conditions favoring hydrolysis.~ While hydrolysis is primarily due to the\nslight extent to which either the acid or the base formed is\ndissociated, several other factors have an influence upon the extent to\nwhich it will take place.",
  "1. _Influence of mass._ Since hydrolysis is a reversible reaction, the\nrelative masses of the reacting substances influence the point at which\nequilibrium will be reached. In the equilibrium",
  "BiCl_{3} + 3H_{2}O <--> Bi(OH)_{3} + 3HCl",
  "the addition of more water will result in the formation of more bismuth\nhydroxide and hydrochloric acid. The addition of more hydrochloric acid\nwill convert some of the bismuth hydroxide into bismuth chloride.",
  "2. _Formation of insoluble substances._ When one of the products of\nhydrolysis is nearly insoluble in water the solution will become\nsaturated with it as soon as a very little has been formed. All in\nexcess of this will precipitate, and the reaction will go on until the\nacid set free increases sufficiently to bring about an equilibrium. Thus\na considerable amount of bismuth and antimony hydroxides are\nprecipitated when water is added to the chlorides of these elements. The\ngreater the dilution the more hydroxide precipitates. The addition of\nhydrochloric acid in considerable quantity will, however, redissolve the\nprecipitate.",
  "~Partial hydrolysis.~ In many cases the hydrolysis of a salt is only\npartial, resulting in the formation of basic salts instead of the free\nbase. Most of these basic salts are insoluble in water, which accounts\nfor their ready formation. Thus bismuth chloride may hydrolyze by\nsuccessive steps, as shown in the equations",
  "BiCl_{3} + H_{2}O = Bi(OH)Cl_{2} + HCl,",
  "BiCl_{3} + 2H_{2}O = Bi(OH)_{2}Cl + 2HCl,",
  "BiCl_{3} + 3H_{2}O = Bi(OH)_{3} + 3HCl.",
  "The basic salt so formed may also lose water, as shown in the equation",
  "Bi(OH)_{2}Cl = BiOCl + H_{2}O.",
  "The salt represented in the last equation is sometimes called bismuth\noxychloride, or bismuthyl chloride. The corresponding nitrate,\nBiONO_{3}, is largely used in medicine under the name of subnitrate of\nbismuth. In these two compounds the group of atoms, BiO, acts as a\nunivalent metallic radical and is called _bismuthyl_. Similar basic\nsalts are formed by the hydrolysis of antimony salts.",

  "~General.~ Each of the three elements, silicon, titanium, and boron,\nbelongs to a separate periodic family, but they occur near together in\nthe periodic grouping and are very similar in both physical and chemical\nproperties. Since the other elements in their families are either so\nrare that they cannot be studied in detail, or are best understood in\nconnection with other elements, it is convenient to consider these three\ntogether at this point.",
  "The three elements are very difficult to obtain in the free state, owing\nto their strong attraction for other elements. They can be prepared by\nthe action of aluminium or magnesium on their oxides and in impure state\nby reduction with carbon in an electric furnace. They are very hard and\nmelt only at the highest temperatures. At ordinary temperatures they are\nnot attacked by oxygen, but when strongly heated they burn with great\nbrilliancy. Silicon and boron are not attacked by acids under ordinary\nconditions; titanium is easily dissolved by them.",
  "SILICON",
  "~Occurrence.~ Next to oxygen silicon is the most abundant element. It does\nnot occur free in nature, but its compounds are very abundant and of the\ngreatest importance. It occurs almost entirely in combination with\noxygen as silicon dioxide (SiO_{2}), often called silica, or with oxygen\nand various metals in the form of salts of silicic acids, or silicates.\nThese compounds form a large fraction of the earth's crust. Most plants\nabsorb small amounts of silica from the soil, and it is also found in\nminute quantities in animal organisms.",
  "~Preparation.~ The element is most easily prepared by reducing pure\npowdered quartz with magnesium powder:",
  "SiO_{2} + 2Mg = 2MgO + Si.",
  "~Properties.~ As would be expected from its place in the periodic table,\nsilicon resembles carbon in many respects. It can be obtained in several\nallotropic forms, corresponding to those of carbon. The crystallized\nform is very hard, and is inactive toward reagents. The amorphous\nvariety has, in general, properties more similar to charcoal.",
  "~Compounds of silicon with hydrogen and the halogens.~ Silicon hydride\n(SiH_{4}) corresponds in formula to methane (CH_{4}), but its properties\nare more like those of phosphine (PH_{3}). It is a very inflammable gas\nof disagreeable odor, and, as ordinarily prepared, takes fire\nspontaneously on account of the presence of impurities.",
  "Silicon combines with the elements of the chlorine family to form such\ncompounds as SiCl_{4} and SiF_{4}. Of these silicon fluoride is the most\nfamiliar and interesting. As stated in the discussion of fluorine, it is\nformed when hydrofluoric acid acts upon silicon dioxide or a silicate.\nWith silica the reaction is thus expressed:",
  "SiO_{2} + 4HF = SiF_{4} + 2H_{2}O.",
  "It is a very volatile, invisible, poisonous gas. In contact with water\nit is partially decomposed, as shown in the equation",
  "SiF_{4} + 4H_{2}O = 4HF + Si(OH)_{4}.",
  "The hydrofluoric acid so formed combines with an additional amount of\nsilicon fluoride, forming the complex fluosilicic acid (H_{2}SiF_{6}),\nthus:",
  "2HF + SiF_{4} = H_{2}SiF_{6}.",
  "~Silicides.~ As the name indicates, silicides are binary compounds\nconsisting of silicon and some other element. They are very stable at\nhigh temperatures, and are usually made by heating the appropriate\nsubstances in an electric furnace. The most important one is\n_carborundum_, which is a silicide of carbon of the formula CSi. It is\nmade by heating coke and sand, which is a form of silicon dioxide, in an\nelectric furnace, the process being extensively carried on at Niagara\nFalls. The following equation represents the reaction",
  "SiO_{2} + 3C = CSi + 2CO.",
  "The substance so prepared consists of beautiful purplish-black crystals,\nwhich are very hard. Carborundum is used as an abrasive, that is, as a\nmaterial for grinding and polishing very hard substances. Ferrosilicon\nis a silicide of iron alloyed with an excess of iron, which finds\nextensive use in the manufacture of certain kinds of steel.",
  "~Manufacture of carborundum.~ The mixture of materials is heated in a\nlarge resistance furnace for about thirty-six hours. After the reaction\nis completed there is left a core of graphite G. Surrounding this core\nis a layer of crystallized carborundum C, about 16 in. thick. Outside\nthis is a shell of amorphous carborundum A. The remaining materials\nM are unchanged and are used for a new charge.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 73]",
  "~Silicon dioxide~ (_silica_) (SiO_{2}). This substance is found in a great\nvariety of forms in nature, both in the amorphous and in the crystalline\ncondition. In the form of quartz it is found in beautifully formed\nsix-sided prisms, sometimes of great size. When pure it is perfectly\ntransparent and colorless. Some colored varieties are given special\nnames, as amethyst (violet), rose quartz (pale pink), smoky or milky\nquartz (colored and opaque). Other varieties of silicon dioxide, some of\nwhich also contain water, are chalcedony, onyx, jasper, opal, agate, and\nflint. Sand and sandstone are largely silicon dioxide.",
  "~Properties.~ As obtained by chemical processes silicon dioxide is an\namorphous white powder. In the crystallized state it is very hard and\nhas a density of 2.6. It is insoluble in water and in most chemical\nreagents, and requires the hottest oxyhydrogen flame for fusion. Acids,\nexcepting hydrofluoric acid, have little action on it, and it requires\nthe most energetic reducing agents to deprive it of oxygen. It is the\nanhydride of an acid, and consequently it dissolves in fused alkalis to\nform silicates. Being nonvolatile, it will drive out most other\nanhydrides when heated to a high temperature with their salts,\nespecially when the silicates so formed are fusible. The following\nequations illustrate this property:",
  "Na_{2}CO_{3} + SiO_{2} = Na_{2}SiO_{3} + CO_{2},",
  "Na_{2}SO_{4} + SiO_{2} = Na_{2}SiO_{3} + SO_{3}.",
  "~Silicic acids.~ Silicon forms two simple acids, orthosilicic acid\n(H_{4}SiO_{4}) and metasilicic acid (H_{2}SiO_{3}). Orthosilicic acid is\nformed as a jelly-like mass when orthosilicates are treated with strong\nacids such as hydrochloric. On attempting to dry this acid it loses\nwater, passing into metasilicic or common silicic acid:",
  "H_{4}SiO_{4} = H_{2}SiO_{3} + H_{2}O.",
  "Metasilicic acid when heated breaks up into silica and water, thus:",
  "H_{2}SiO_{3} = H_{2}O + SiO_{2}.",
  "~Salts of silicic acids,--silicates.~ A number of salts of the\n     orthosilicic and metasilicic acids occur in nature. Thus mica\n     (KAlSiO_{4}) is a salt of orthosilicic acid.",
  "~Polysilicic acids.~ Silicon has the power to form a great many complex\nacids which may be regarded as derived from the union of several\nmolecules of the orthosilicic acid, with the loss of water. Thus we have",
  "3H_{4}SiO_{4} = H_{4}Si_{3}O_{8} + 4H_{2}O.",
  "These acids cannot be prepared in the pure state, but their salts form\nmany of the crystalline rocks in nature. Feldspar, for example, has the\nformula KAlSi_{3}O_{8}, and is a mixed salt of the acid\nH_{4}Si_{3}O_{8}, whose formation is represented in the equation above.\nKaolin has the formula Al_{2}Si_{2}O_{7}·2H_{2}O. Many other examples\nwill be met in the study of the metals.",
  "~Glass.~ When sodium and calcium silicates, together with silicon dioxide,\nare heated to a very high temperature, the mixture slowly fuses to a\ntransparent liquid, which on cooling passes into the solid called glass.\nInstead of starting with sodium and calcium silicates it is more\nconvenient and economical to heat sodium carbonate (or sulphate) and\nlime with an excess of clean sand, the silicates being formed during the\nheating:",
  "Na_{2}CO_{3} + SiO_{2} = Na_{2}SiO_{3} + CO_{2},",
  "CaO + SiO_{2} = CaSiO_{3}.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 74]",
  "The mixture is heated below the fusing point for some time, so that the\nescaping carbon dioxide may not spatter the hot liquid; the heat is then\nincreased and the mixture kept in a state of fusion until all gases\nformed in the reaction have escaped.",
  "_Molding and blowing of glass._ The way in which the melted mixture is\nhandled in the glass factory depends upon the character of the article\nto be made. Many articles, such as bottles, are made by blowing the\nplastic glass into hollow molds of the desired shape. The mold is first\nopened, as shown in Fig. 74. A lump of plastic glass A on the hollow\nrod B is lowered into the mold, which is then closed by the handles\nC. By blowing into the tube the glass is blown into the shape of the\nmold. The mold is then opened and the bottle lifted out. The neck of the\nbottle must be cut off at the proper place and the sharp edges rounded\noff in a flame.",
  "Other objects, such as lamp chimneys, are made by getting a lump of\nplastic glass on the end of a hollow iron rod and blowing it into the\ndesired shape without the help of a mold, great skill being required in\nthe manipulation of the glass. Window glass is made by blowing large\nhollow cylinders about 6 ft. long and 1-1/2 ft. in diameter. These are\ncut longitudinally, and are then placed in an oven and heated until they\nsoften, when they are flattened out into plates (Fig. 75). Plate glass\nis cast into flat slabs, which are then ground and polished to perfectly\nplane surfaces.",
  "_Varieties of glass._ The ingredients mentioned above make a soft,\neasily fusible glass. If potassium carbonate is substituted for the\nsodium carbonate, the glass is much harder and less easily fused;\nincreasing the amount of sand has somewhat the same effect. Potassium\nglass is largely used in making chemical glassware, since it resists the\naction of reagents better than the softer sodium glass. If lead oxide is\nsubstituted for the whole or a part of the lime, the glass is very soft,\nbut has a high index of refraction and is valuable for making optical\ninstruments and artificial jewels.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 75]",
  "_Coloring of glass._ Various substances fused along with the glass\nmixture give characteristic colors. The amber color of common bottles is\ndue to iron compounds in the glass; in other cases iron colors the glass\ngreen. Cobalt compounds color it deep blue; those of manganese give it\nan amethyst tint and uranium compounds impart a peculiar yellowish green\ncolor. Since iron is nearly always present in the ingredients, glass is\nusually slightly yellow. This color can be removed by adding the proper\namount of manganese dioxide, for the amethyst color of manganese and the\nyellow of iron together produce white light.",
  "_Nature of glass._ Glass is not a definite chemical compound and its\ncomposition varies between wide limits. Fused glass is really a solution\nof various silicates, such as those of calcium and lead, in fused sodium\nor potassium silicate. A certain amount of silicon dioxide is also\npresent. This solution is then allowed to solidify under such conditions\nof cooling that the dissolved substances do not separate from the\nsolvent. The compounds which are used to color the glass are sometimes\nconverted into silicates, which then dissolve in the glass, giving it a\nuniform color. In other cases, as in the milky glasses which resemble\nporcelain in appearance, the color or opaqueness is due to the finely\ndivided color material evenly distributed throughout the glass, but not\ndissolved in it. Milky glass is made by mixing calcium fluoride, tin\noxide, or some other insoluble substance in the melted glass. Copper or\ngold in metallic form scattered through glass gives it shades of red.",
  "TITANIUM",
  "Titanium is a very widely distributed element in nature, being\n     found in almost all soils, in many rocks, and even in plant and\n     animal tissues. It is not very abundant in any one locality,\n     and it possesses little commercial value save in connection\n     with the iron industry. Its most common ore is rutile\n     (TiO_{2}), which resembles silica in many respects.",
  "In both physical and chemical properties titanium resembles\n     silicon, though it is somewhat more metallic in character. This\n     resemblance is most marked in the acids of titanium. It not\n     only forms metatitanic and orthotitanic acids but a great\n     variety of polytitanic acids as well.",
  "BORON",
  "~Occurrence.~ Boron is never found free in nature. It occurs as boric acid\n(H_{3}BO_{3}), and in salts of polyboric acids, which usually have very\ncomplicated formulas.",
  "~Preparation and properties.~ Boron can be prepared from its oxide by\nreduction with magnesium, exactly as in the case of silicon. It\nresembles silicon very strikingly in its properties. It occurs in\nseveral allotropic forms, is very hard when crystallized, and is rather\ninactive toward reagents. It forms a hydride, BH_{3}, and combines\ndirectly with the elements of the chlorine family. Boron fluoride\n(BF_{3}) is very similar to silicon fluoride in its mode of formation\nand chemical properties.",
  "~Boric oxide~ (B_{2}O_{3}). Boron forms one well-known oxide, B_{2}O_{3},\ncalled boric anhydride. It is formed as a glassy mass by heating boric\nacid to a high temperature. It absorbs water very readily, uniting with\nit to form boric acid again:",
  "B_{2}O_{3} + 3H_{2}O = 2H_{3}BO_{3}.",
  "In this respect it differs from silicon dioxide, which will not combine\ndirectly with water.",
  "~Boric acid~ (H_{3}BO_{3}). This is found in nature in considerable\nquantities and forms one of the chief sources of boron compounds. It is\nfound dissolved in the water of hot springs in some localities,\nparticularly in Italy. Being volatile with steam, the vapor which\nescapes from these springs has some boric acid in it. It is easily\nobtained from these sources by condensation and evaporation, the\nnecessary heat being supplied by other hot springs.",
  "Boric acid crystallizes in pearly flakes, which are greasy to the touch.\nIn the laboratory it is easily prepared by treating a strong, hot\nsolution of borax with sulphuric acid. Boric acid being sparingly\nsoluble in water crystallizes out on cooling:",
  "Na_{2}B_{4}O_{7} + 5H_{2}O + H_{2}SO_{4} = Na_{2}SO_{4} + 4H_{3}BO_{3}.",
  "The substance is a mild antiseptic, and on this account is often used in\nmedicine and as a preservative for canned foods and milk.",
  "~Metaboric and polyboric acids.~ When boric acid is gently heated it is\nconverted into metaboric acid (HBO_{2}):",
  "H_{3}BO_{3} = HBO_{2} + H_{2}O.",
  "On heating metaboric acid to a somewhat higher temperature tetraboric\nacid (H_{2}B_{4}O_{7}) is formed:",
  "4HBO_{2} = H_{2}B_{4}O_{7} + H_{2}O.",
  "Many other complex acids of boron are known.",
  "~Borax.~ Borax is the sodium salt of tetraboric acid, having the formula\nNa_{2}B_{4}O_{7}·10 H_{2}O. It is found in some arid countries, as\nsouthern California and Tibet, but is now made commercially from the\nmineral colemanite, which is the calcium salt of a complex boric acid.\nWhen this is treated with a solution of sodium carbonate, calcium\ncarbonate is precipitated and borax crystallizes from the solution.",
  "When heated borax at first swells up greatly, owing to the expulsion of\nthe water of crystallization, and then melts to a clear glass. This\nglass has the property of easily dissolving many metallic oxides, and on\nthis account borax is used as a flux in soldering, for the purpose of\nremoving from the metallic surfaces to be soldered the film of oxide\nwith which they are likely to be covered. These oxides often give a\ncharacteristic color to the clear borax glass, and borax beads are\ntherefore often used in testing for the presence of metals, instead of\nthe metaphosphoric acid bead already described.",
  "The reason that metallic oxides dissolve in borax is that borax\n     contains an excess of acid anhydride, as can be more easily\n     seen if its formula is written 2NaBO_{2} + B_{2}O_{3}. The\n     metallic oxide combines with this excess of acid anhydride,\n     forming a mixed salt of metaboric acid.",
  "Borax is extensively used as a constituent of enamels and glazes for\nboth metal ware and pottery. It is also used as a flux in soldering and\nbrazing, and in domestic ways it serves as a mild alkali, as a\npreservative for meats, and in a great variety of less important\napplications.",

  "THE METALS",
  "~The metals.~ The elements which remain to be considered are known\ncollectively as the metals. They are also called the base-forming\nelements, since their hydroxides are bases. A metal may therefore be\ndefined as an element whose hydroxide is a base. When a base dissolves\nin water the hydroxyl groups form the anions, while the metallic element\nforms the cations. From this standpoint a metal can be defined as an\nelement capable of forming simple cations in solution.",
  "The distinction between a metal and a non-metal is not a very sharp one,\nsince the hydroxides of a number of elements act as bases under some\nconditions and as acids under others. We have seen that antimony is an\nelement of this kind.",
  "~Occurrence of metals in nature.~ A few of the metals are found in nature\nin the free state. Among these are gold, platinum, and frequently\ncopper. They are usually found combined with other elements in the form\nof oxides or salts of various acids. Silicates, carbonates, sulphides,\nand sulphates are the most abundant salts. All inorganic substances\noccurring in nature, whether they contain a metal or not, are called\n_minerals_. Those minerals from which a useful substance can be\nextracted are called _ores_ of the substance. These two terms are most\nfrequently used in connection with the metals.",
  "~Extraction of metals,--metallurgy.~ The process of extracting a metal\nfrom its ores is called the metallurgy of the metal. The metallurgy of\neach metal presents peculiarities of its own, but there are several\nmethods of general application which are very frequently employed.",
  "1. _Reduction of an oxide with carbon._ Many of the metals occur in\nnature in the form of oxides. When these oxides are heated to a high\ntemperature with carbon the oxygen combines with it and the metal is set\nfree. Iron, for example, occurs largely in the form of the oxide\nFe_{2}O_{3}. When this is heated with carbon the reaction expressed in\nthe following equation takes place:",
  "Fe_{2}O_{3} + 3 C = 2 Fe + 3 CO.",
  "Many ores other than oxides may be changed into oxides which can then be\nreduced by carbon. The conversion of such ores into oxides is generally\naccomplished by heating, and this process is called _roasting_. Many\ncarbonates and hydroxides decompose directly into the oxide on heating.\nSulphides, on the other hand, must be heated in a current of air, the\noxygen of the air entering into the reaction. The following equations\nwill serve to illustrate these changes in the case of the ores of iron:",
  "FeCO_{3} = FeO + CO_{2},",
  "2Fe(OH)_{3} = Fe_{2}O_{3} + 3H_{2}O,",
  "2FeS_{2} + 11O = Fe_{2}O_{3} + 4SO_{2}.",
  "2. _Reduction of an oxide with aluminium._ Not all oxides, however, can\nbe reduced by carbon. In such cases aluminium may be used. Thus chromium\nmay be obtained in accordance with the following equation:",
  "Cr_{2}O_{3} + 2 Al = 2 Cr + Al_{2}O_{3}.",
  "This method is a comparatively new one, having been brought into use by\nthe German chemist Goldschmidt; hence it is sometimes called the\nGoldschmidt method.",
  "3. _Electrolysis._ In recent years increasing use is being made of the\nelectric current in the preparation of metals. In some cases the\nseparation of the metal from its compounds is accomplished by passing\nthe current through a solution of a suitable salt of the metal, the\nmetal usually being deposited upon the cathode. In other cases the\ncurrent is passed through a fused salt of the metal, the chloride being\nbest adapted to this purpose.",
  "~Electro-chemical industries.~ Most of the electro-chemical industries of\nthe country are carried on where water power is abundant, since this\nfurnishes the cheapest means for the generation of electrical energy.\nNiagara Falls is the most important locality in this country for such\nindustries, and many different electro-chemical products are\nmanufactured there. Some industries depend upon electrolytic processes,\nwhile in others the electrical energy is used merely as a source of heat\nin electric furnaces.",
  "~Preparation of compounds of the metals.~ Since the compounds of the\nmetals are so numerous and varied in character, there are many ways of\npreparing them. In many cases the properties of the substance to be\nprepared, or the material available for its preparation, suggest a\nrather unusual way. There are, however, a number of general principles\nwhich are constantly applied in the preparation of the compounds of the\nmetals, and a clear understanding of them will save much time and effort\nin remembering the details in any given case. The most important of\nthese general methods for the preparation of compounds are the\nfollowing:",
  "1. _By direct union of two elements._ This is usually accomplished by\nheating the two elements together. Thus the sulphides, chlorides, and\noxides of a metal can generally be obtained in this way. The following\nequations serve as examples of this method:",
  "Fe + S = FeS,",
  "Mg + O = MgO,",
  "Cu + 2Cl = CuCl_{2}.",
  "2. _By the decomposition of a compound._ This decomposition may be\nbrought about either by heat alone or by the combined action of heat and\na reducing agent. Thus when the nitrate of a metal is heated the oxide\nof the metal is usually obtained. Copper nitrate, for example,\ndecomposes as follows:",
  "Cu(NO_{3})_{2} = CuO + 2NO_{2} + O.",
  "Similarly the carbonates of the metals yield oxides, thus:",
  "CaCO_{3} = CaO + CO_{2}.",
  "Most of the hydroxides form an oxide and water when heated:",
  "2Al(OH)_{3} = Al_{2}O_{3} + 3H_{2}O.",
  "When heated with carbon, sulphates are reduced to sulphides, thus:",
  "BaSO_{4} + 2C = BaS + 2CO_{2}.",
  "3. _Methods based on equilibrium in solution._ In the preparation of\ncompounds the first requisite is that the reactions chosen shall be of\nsuch a kind as will go on to completion. In the chapter on chemical\nequilibrium it was shown that reactions in solution may become complete\nin either of three ways: (1) a gas may be formed which escapes from\nsolution; (2) an insoluble solid may be formed which precipitates; (3)\ntwo different ions may combine to form undissociated molecules. By the\njudicious selection of materials these principles may be applied to the\npreparation of a great variety of compounds, and illustrations of such\nmethods will very frequently be found in the subsequent pages.",
  "4. _By fusion methods._ It sometimes happens that substances which are\ninsoluble in water and in acids, and which cannot therefore be brought\ninto double decomposition in the usual way, are soluble in other\nliquids, and when dissolved in them can be decomposed and converted into\nother desired compounds. Thus barium sulphate is not soluble in water,\nand sulphuric acid, being less volatile than most other acids, cannot\neasily be driven out from this salt When brought into contact with\nmelted sodium carbonate, however, it dissolves in it, and since barium\ncarbonate is insoluble in melted sodium carbonate, double decomposition\ntakes place:",
  "Na_{2}CO_{3} + BaSO_{4} = BaCO_{3} + Na_{2}SO_{4}.",
  "On dissolving the cooled mixture in water the sodium sulphate formed in\nthe reaction, together with any excess of sodium carbonate which may be\npresent, dissolves. The barium carbonate can then be filtered off and\nconverted into any desired salt by the processes already described.",
  "5. _By the action of metals on salts of other metals._ When a strip of\nzinc is placed in a solution of a copper salt the copper is precipitated\nand an equivalent quantity of zinc passes into solution:",
  "Zn + CuSO_{4} = Cu + ZnSO_{4}.",
  "In like manner copper will precipitate silver from its salts:",
  "Cu + Ag_{2}SO_{4} = 2Ag + CuSO_{4}.",
  "It is possible to tabulate the metals in such a way that any one of them\nin the table will precipitate any one following it from its salts. The\nfollowing is a list of some of the commoner metals arranged in this way:",
  "Zinc\n    Iron\n    Tin\n    Lead\n    Copper\n    Bismuth\n    Mercury\n    Silver\n    Gold",
  "According to this table copper will precipitate bismuth, mercury,\nsilver, or gold from their salts, and will in turn be precipitated by\nzinc, iron, tin, or lead. Advantage is taken of this principle in the\npurification of some of the metals, and occasionally in the preparation\nof metals and their compounds.",
  "~Important insoluble compounds.~ Since precipitates play so important a\npart in the reactions which substances undergo, as well as in the\npreparation of many chemical compounds, it is important to know what\nsubstances are insoluble. Knowing this, we can in many cases predict\nreactions under certain conditions, and are assisted in devising ways to\nprepare desired compounds. While there is no general rule which will\nenable one to foretell the solubility of any given compound,\nnevertheless a few general statements can be made which will be of much\nassistance.",
  "1. _Hydroxides._ All hydroxides are insoluble save those of ammonium,\nsodium, potassium, calcium, barium, and strontium.",
  "2. _Nitrates._ All nitrates are soluble in water.",
  "3. _Chlorides._ All chlorides are soluble save silver and mercurous\nchlorides. (Lead chloride is but slightly soluble.)",
  "4. _Sulphates._ All sulphates are soluble save those of barium,\nstrontium, and lead. (Sulphates of silver and calcium are only\nmoderately soluble.)",
  "5. _Sulphides._ All sulphides are insoluble save those of ammonium,\nsodium, and potassium. The sulphides of calcium, barium, strontium, and\nmagnesium are insoluble in water, but are changed by hydrolysis into\nacid sulphides which are soluble. On this account they cannot be\nprepared by precipitation.",
  "6. _Carbonates, phosphates, and silicates._ All normal carbonates,\nphosphates, and silicates are insoluble save those of ammonium, sodium\nand potassium.",
  "EXERCISES",
  "1. Write equations representing four different ways for preparing\nCu(NO_{3})_{2}.",
  "2. Write equations representing six different ways for preparing\nZnSO_{4}.",
  "3. Write equations for two reactions to illustrate each of the three\nways in which reactions in solutions may become complete.",
  "4. Give one or more methods for preparing each of the following\ncompounds: CaCl_{2}, PbCl_{2}, BaSO_{4}, CaCO_{3}, (NH_{4})_{2}S,\nAg_{2}S, PbO, Cu(OH)_{2} (for solubilities, see last paragraph of\nchapter). State in each case the general principle involved in the\nmethod of preparation chosen.",

  "~The family.~ The metals listed in the above table constitute the even\nfamily in Group I in the periodic arrangement of the elements, and\ntherefore form a natural family. The name alkali metals is commonly\napplied to the family for the reason that the hydroxides of the most\nfamiliar members of the family, namely sodium and potassium, have long\nbeen called alkalis.",
  "1. _Occurrence._ While none of these metals occur free in nature, their\ncompounds are very widely distributed, being especially abundant in sea\nand mineral waters, in salt beds, and in many rocks. Only sodium and\npotassium occur in abundance, the others being rarely found in any\nconsiderable quantity.",
  "2. _Preparation._ The metals are most conveniently prepared by the\nelectrolysis of their fused hydroxides or chlorides, though it is\npossible to prepare them by reducing their oxides or carbonates with\ncarbon.",
  "3. _Properties._ They are soft, light metals, having low melting points\nand small densities, as is indicated in the table. Their melting points\nvary inversely with their atomic weights, while their densities (sodium\nexcepted) vary directly with these. The pure metals have a silvery\nluster but tarnish at once when exposed to the air, owing to the\nformation of a film of oxide upon the surface of the metal. They are\ntherefore preserved in some liquid, such as coal oil, which contains no\noxygen. Because of their strong affinity for oxygen they decompose water\nwith great ease, forming hydroxides and liberating hydrogen in\naccordance with the equation",
  "M + H_{2}O = MOH + H,",
  "where M stands for any one of these metals. These hydroxides are white\nsolids; they are readily soluble in water and possess very strong basic\nproperties. These bases are nearly equal in strength, that is, they all\ndissociate in water to about the same extent.",
  "4. _Compounds._ The alkali metals almost always act as univalent\nelements in the formation of compounds, the composition of which can be\nrepresented by such formulas as MH, MCl, MNO_{3}, M_{2}SO_{4},\nM_{3}PO_{4}. These compounds, when dissolved in water, dissociate in\nsuch a way as to form simple, univalent metallic ions which are\ncolorless. With the exception of lithium these metals form very few\ninsoluble compounds, so that it is not often that precipitates\ncontaining them are obtained. Only sodium and potassium will be studied\nin detail, since the other metals of the family are of relatively small\nimportance.",
  "The compounds of sodium and potassium are so similar in properties that\nthey can be used interchangeably for most purposes. Other things being\nequal, the sodium compounds are prepared in preference to those of\npotassium, since they are cheaper. When a given sodium compound is\ndeliquescent, or is so soluble that it is difficult to purify, the\ncorresponding potassium compound is prepared in its stead, provided its\nproperties are more desirable in these respects.",
  "SODIUM",
  "~Occurrence in nature.~ Large deposits of sodium chloride have been found\nin various parts of the world, and the water of the ocean and of many\nlakes and springs contains notable quantities of it. The element also\noccurs as a constituent of many rocks and is therefore present in the\nsoil formed by their disintegration. The mineral cryolite\n(Na_{3}AlF_{6}) is an important substance, and the nitrate, carbonate,\nand borate also occur in nature.",
  "~Preparation.~ In 1807 Sir Humphry Davy succeeded in preparing very small\nquantities of metallic sodium by the electrolysis of the fused\nhydroxide. On account of the cost of electrical energy it was for many\nyears found more economical to prepare it by reducing the carbonate with\ncarbon in accordance with the following equation:",
  "Na_{2}CO_{3} + 2C = 2Na + 3CO.",
  "The cost of generating the electric current has been diminished to such\nan extent, however, that it is now more economical to prepare sodium by\nDavy's original method, namely, by the electrolysis of the fused\nhydroxide or chloride. When the chloride is used the process is\ndifficult to manage, owing to the higher temperature required to keep\nthe electrolyte fused, and because of the corroding action of the fused\nchloride upon the containing vessel.",
  "[Illustration: SIR HUMPHRY DAVY (English) (1778-1829)",
  "Isolated sodium, lithium, potassium, barium, strontium, and calcium by\nmeans of electrolysis; demonstrated the elementary nature of chlorine;\ninvented the safety lamp; discovered the stupefying effects of nitrous\noxide]",
  "~Technical preparation.~ The sodium hydroxide is melted in a\n     cylindrical iron vessel (Fig. 76) through the bottom of which\n     rises the cathode K. The anodes A, several in number, are\n     suspended around the cathode from above. A cylindrical vessel\n     C floats in the fused alkali directly over the cathode, and\n     under this cap the sodium and hydrogen liberated at the cathode\n     collect. The hydrogen escapes by lifting the cover, and the\n     sodium, protected from the air by the hydrogen, is skimmed or\n     drained off from time to time. Oxygen is set free upon the\n     anode and escapes into the air through the openings O without\n     coming into contact with the sodium or hydrogen. This process\n     is carried on extensively at Niagara Falls.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 76]",
  "~Properties.~ Sodium is a silver-white metal about as heavy as water, and\nso soft that it can be molded easily by the fingers or pressed into\nwire. It is very active chemically, combining with most of the\nnon-metallic elements, such as oxygen and chlorine, with great energy.\nIt will often withdraw these elements from combination with other\nelements, and is thus able to decompose water and the oxides and\nchlorides of many metals.",
  "~Sodium peroxide~ (NaO). Since sodium is a univalent element we should\nexpect it to form an oxide of the formula Na_{2}O. While such an oxide\ncan be prepared, the peroxide (NaO) is much better known. It is a\nyellowish-white powder made by burning sodium in air. Its chief use is\nas an oxidizing agent. When heated with oxidizable substances it gives\nup a part of its oxygen, as shown in the equation",
  "2NaO = Na_{2}O + O.",
  "Water decomposes it in accordance with the equation",
  "2NaO + 2H_{2}O = 2NaOH + H_{2}O_{2}.",
  "Acids act readily upon it, forming a sodium salt and hydrogen peroxide:",
  "2NaO + 2HCl = 2NaCl + H_{2}O_{2}.",
  "In these last two reactions the hydrogen dioxide formed may decompose\ninto water and oxygen if the temperature is allowed to rise:",
  "H_{2}O_{2} = H_{2}O + O.",
  "~Peroxides.~ It will be remembered that barium dioxide (BaO_{2})\n     yields hydrogen dioxide when treated with acids, and that\n     manganese dioxide gives up oxygen when heated with sulphuric\n     acid. Oxides which yield either hydrogen dioxide or oxygen when\n     treated with water or an acid are called peroxides.",
  "~Sodium hydroxide~ (_caustic soda_) (NaOH). 1. _Preparation._ Sodium\nhydroxide is prepared commercially by several processes.",
  "(a) In the older process, still in extensive use, sodium carbonate is\ntreated with calcium hydroxide suspended in water. Calcium carbonate is\nprecipitated according to the equation",
  "Na_{2}CO_{3} + Ca(OH)_{2} = CaCO_{3} + 2NaOH.",
  "The dilute solution of sodium hydroxide, filtered from the calcium\ncarbonate, is evaporated to a paste and is then poured into molds to\nsolidify. It is sold in the form of slender sticks.",
  "(b) The newer methods depend upon the electrolysis of sodium chloride.\nIn the Castner process a solution of salt is electrolyzed, the reaction\nbeing expressed as follows:",
  "NaCl + H_{2}O = NaOH + H + Cl.",
  "The chlorine escapes as a gas, and by an ingenious mechanical device the\nsodium hydroxide is prevented from mixing with the salt in the solution.",
  "In the Acker process the electrolyte is _fused_ sodium chloride. The\nchlorine is evolved as a gas at the anode, while the sodium alloys with\nthe melted lead which forms the cathode. When this alloy is treated with\nwater the following reaction takes place:",
  "Na + H_{2}O = NaOH + H.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 77]",
  "~Technical process.~ A sketch of an Acker furnace is represented in Fig.\n77. The furnace is an irregularly shaped cast-iron box, divided into\nthree compartments, A, B, and C. Compartment A is lined with\nmagnesia brick. Compartments B and C are filled with melted lead,\nwhich also covers the bottom of A to a depth of about an inch. Above\nthis layer in A is fused salt, into which dip carbon anodes D. The\nmetallic box and melted lead is the cathode.",
  "When the furnace is in operation chlorine is evolved at the\n     anodes, and is drawn away through a pipe (not represented) to\n     the bleaching-powder chambers. Sodium is set free at the\n     surface of the melted lead in A, and at once alloys with it.\n     Through the pipe E a powerful jet of steam is driven through\n     the lead in B upwards into the narrow tube F. This forces\n     the lead alloy up through the tube and over into the chamber\n     G.",
  "In this process the steam is decomposed by the sodium in the\n     alloy, forming melted sodium hydroxide and hydrogen. The melted\n     lead and sodium hydroxide separate into two layers in G, and\n     the sodium hydroxide, being on top, overflows into tanks from\n     which it is drawn off and packed in metallic drums. The lead is\n     returned to the other compartments of the furnace by a pipe\n     leading from H to I. Compartment C serves merely as a\n     reservoir for excess of melted lead.",
  "2. _Properties._ Sodium hydroxide is a white, crystalline, brittle\nsubstance which rapidly absorbs water and carbon dioxide from the air.\nAs the name (caustic soda) indicates, it is a very corrosive substance,\nhaving a disintegrating action on most animal and vegetable tissues. It\nis a strong base. It is used in a great many chemical industries, and\nunder the name of lye is employed to a small extent as a cleansing agent\nfor household purposes.",
  "~Sodium chloride~ (_common salt_) (NaCl). 1. _Preparation._ Sodium\nchloride, or common salt, is very widely distributed in nature. Thick\nstrata, evidently deposited at one time by the evaporation of salt\nwater, are found in many places. In the United States the most important\nlocalities for salt are New York, Michigan, Ohio, and Kansas. Sometimes\nthe salt is mined, especially if it is in the pure form called rock\nsalt. More frequently a strong brine is pumped from deep wells sunk into\nthe salt deposit, and is then evaporated in large pans until the salt\ncrystallizes out. The crystals are in the form of small cubes and\ncontain no water of crystallization; some water is, however, held in\ncavities in the crystals and causes the salt to decrepitate when heated.",
  "2. _Uses._ Since salt is so abundant in nature it forms the starting\npoint in the preparation of all compounds containing either sodium or\nchlorine. This includes many substances of the highest importance to\ncivilization, such as soap, glass, hydrochloric acid, soda, and\nbleaching powder. Enormous quantities of salt are therefore produced\neach year. Small quantities are essential to the life of man and\nanimals. Pure salt does not absorb moisture; the fact that ordinary salt\nbecomes moist in air is not due to a property of the salt, but to\nimpurities commonly occurring in it, especially calcium and magnesium\nchlorides.",
  "~Sodium sulphate~ (_Glauber's salt_) (Na_{2}SO_{4}·10H_{2}O). This salt is\nprepared by the action of sulphuric acid upon sodium chloride,\nhydrochloric acid being formed at the same time:",
  "2NaCl + H_{2}SO_{4} = Na_{2}SO_{4} + 2HCl.",
  "Some sodium sulphate is prepared by the reaction represented in the\nequation",
  "MgSO_{4} + 2NaCl = Na_{2}SO_{4} + MgCl_{2}.",
  "The magnesium sulphate required for this reaction is obtained in large\nquantities in the manufacture of potassium chloride, and being of little\nvalue for any other purpose is used in this way. The reaction depends\nupon the fact that sodium sulphate is the least soluble of any of the\nfour factors in the equation, and therefore crystallizes out when hot,\nsaturated solutions of magnesium sulphate and sodium chloride are mixed\ntogether and the resulting mixture cooled.",
  "Sodium sulphate forms large efflorescent crystals. The salt is\nextensively used in the manufacture of sodium carbonate and glass. Small\nquantities are used in medicine.",
  "~Sodium sulphite~ (Na_{2}SO_{3}·7H_{2}O). Sodium sulphite is prepared by\nthe action of sulphur dioxide upon solutions of sodium hydroxide, the\nreaction being analogous to the action of carbon dioxide upon sodium\nhydroxide. Like the carbonate, the sulphite is readily decomposed by\nacids:",
  "Na_{2}SO_{3} + 2HCl = 2NaCl + H_{2}O + SO_{2}.",
  "Because of this reaction sodium sulphite is used as a convenient source\nof sulphur dioxide. It is also used as a disinfectant and a\npreservative.",
  "~Sodium thiosulphate~ (_hyposulphite of soda or \"hypo\"_)\n(Na_{2}S_{2}O_{3}·5H_{2}O). This salt, commonly called sodium\nhyposulphite, or merely hypo, is made by boiling a solution of sodium\nsulphite with sulphur:",
  "Na_{2}SO_{3} + S = Na_{2}S_{2}O_{3}.",
  "It is used in photography and in the bleaching industry, to absorb the\nexcess of chlorine which is left upon the bleached fabrics.",
  "~Thio compounds.~ The prefix \"thio\" means sulphur. It is used to\n     designate substances which may be regarded as derived from\n     oxygen compounds by replacing the whole or a part of their\n     oxygen with sulphur. The thiosulphates may be regarded as\n     sulphates in which one atom of oxygen has been replaced by an\n     atom of sulphur. This may be seen by comparing the formula\n     Na_{2}SO_{4} (sodium sulphate) with the formula\n     Na_{2}S_{2}O_{3} (sodium thiosulphate).",
  "~Sodium carbonate~ (_sal soda_)(Na_{2}CO_{3}·10H_{2}O). There are two\ndifferent methods now employed in the manufacture of this important\nsubstance.",
  "1. _Le Blanc process._ This older process involves several distinct\nreactions, as shown in the following equations.",
  "(a) Sodium chloride is first converted into sodium sulphate:",
  "2NaCl + H_{2}SO_{4} = Na_{2}SO_{4} + 2HCl.",
  "(b) The sodium sulphate is next reduced to sulphide by heating it with\ncarbon:",
  "Na_{2}SO_{4} + 2C = Na_{2}S + 2CO_{2}.",
  "(c) The sodium sulphide is then heated with calcium carbonate, when\ndouble decomposition takes place:",
  "Na_{2}S + CaCO_{3} = CaS + Na_{2}CO_{3}.",
  "~Technical preparation of sodium carbonate.~ In a manufacturing\n     plant the last two reactions take place in one process. Sodium\n     sulphate, coal, and powdered limestone are heated together to a\n     rather high temperature. The coal reduces the sulphate to\n     sulphide, which in turn reacts upon the calcium carbonate. Some\n     limestone is decomposed by the heat, forming calcium oxide.\n     When treated with water the calcium oxide is changed into\n     hydroxide, and this prevents the water from decomposing the\n     insoluble calcium sulphide.",
  "The crude product of the process is a hard black cake called\n     black ash. On digesting this mass with water the sodium\n     carbonate passes into solution. The pure carbonate is obtained\n     by evaporation of this solution, crystallizing from it in\n     crystals of the formula Na_{2}CO_{3}·10H_{2}O. Since over 60%\n     of this salt is water, the crystals are sometimes heated until\n     it is driven off. The product is called calcined soda, and is,\n     of course, more valuable than the crystallized salt.",
  "2. _Solvay process._ This more modern process depends upon the reactions\nrepresented in the equations",
  "NaCl + NH_{4}HCO_{3} = NaHCO_{3} + NH_{4}Cl,",
  "2NaHCO_{3} = Na_{2}CO_{3} + H_{2}O + CO_{2}.",
  "The reason the first reaction takes place is that sodium hydrogen\ncarbonate is sparingly soluble in water, while the other compounds are\nfreely soluble. When strong solutions of sodium chloride and of ammonium\nhydrogen carbonate are brought together the sparingly soluble sodium\nhydrogen carbonate is precipitated. This is converted into the normal\ncarbonate by heating, the reaction being represented in the second\nequation.",
  "~Technical preparation.~ In the Solvay process a very\n     concentrated solution of salt is first saturated with ammonia\n     gas, and a current of carbon dioxide is then conducted into the\n     solution. In this way ammonium hydrogen carbonate is formed:",
  "NH_{3} + H_{2}O + CO_{2} = NH_{4}HCO_{3}.",
  "This enters into double decomposition with the salt, as shown\n     in the first equation under the Solvay process. After the\n     sodium hydrogen carbonate has been precipitated the mother\n     liquors containing ammonium chloride are treated with lime:",
  "2NH_{4}Cl + CaO = CaCl_{2} + 2 NH_{3} + H_{2}O.",
  "The lime is obtained by burning limestone:",
  "CaCO_{3} = CaO + CO_{2}.",
  "The ammonia and carbon dioxide evolved in the latter two\n     reactions are used in the preparation of an additional quantity\n     of ammonium hydrogen carbonate. It will thus be seen that there\n     is no loss of ammonia. The only materials permanently used up\n     are calcium carbonate and salt, while the only waste product is\n     calcium chloride.",
  "~Historical.~ In former times sodium carbonate was made by\n     burning seaweeds and extracting the carbonate from their ash.\n     On this account the salt was called _soda ash_, and the name is\n     still in common use. During the French Revolution this supply\n     was cut off, and in behalf of the French government Le Blanc\n     made a study of methods of preparing the carbonate directly\n     from salt. As a result he devised the method which bears his\n     name, and which was used exclusively for many years. It has\n     been replaced to a large extent by the Solvay process, which\n     has the advantage that the materials used are inexpensive, and\n     that the ammonium hydrogen carbonate used can be regenerated\n     from the products formed in the process. Much expense is also\n     saved in fuel, and the sodium hydrogen carbonate, which is the\n     first product of the process, has itself many commercial uses.\n     The Le Blanc process is still used, however, since the\n     hydrochloric acid generated is of value.",
  "~By-products.~ The substances obtained in a given process, aside\n     from the main product, are called the by-products. The success\n     of many processes depends upon the value of the by-products\n     formed.",
  "Thus hydrochloric acid, a by-product in the Le Blanc process,\n     is valuable enough to make the process pay, even though sodium\n     carbonate can be made cheaper in other ways.",
  "~Properties of sodium carbonate.~ Sodium carbonate forms large crystals of\nthe formula Na_{2}CO_{3} · 10 H_{2}O. It has a mild alkaline reaction\nand is used for laundry purposes under the name of washing soda. Mere\nmention of the fact that it is used in the manufacture of glass, soap,\nand many chemical reagents will indicate its importance in the\nindustries. It is one of the few soluble carbonates.",
  "~Sodium hydrogen carbonate~ (_bicarbonate of soda_) (NaHCO_{3}). This\nsalt, commonly called bicarbonate of soda, or baking soda, is made by\nthe Solvay process, as explained above, or by passing carbon dioxide\ninto strong solutions of sodium carbonate:",
  "Na_{2}CO_{3} + H_{2}O + CO_{2} = 2NaHCO_{3}.",
  "The bicarbonate, being sparingly soluble, crystallizes out. A mixture of\nthe bicarbonate with some substance (the compound known as cream of\ntartar is generally used) which slowly reacts with it, liberating carbon\ndioxide, is used largely in baking. The carbon dioxide generated forces\nits way through the dough, thus making it porous and light.",
  "~Sodium nitrate~ (_Chili saltpeter_) (NaNO_{3}). This substance is found\nin nature in arid regions in a number of places, where it has been\nformed apparently by the decay of organic substances in the presence of\nair and sodium salts. The largest deposits are in Chili, and most of the\nnitrate of commerce comes from that country. Smaller deposits occur in\nCalifornia and Nevada. The commercial salt is prepared by dissolving the\ncrude nitrate in water, allowing the insoluble earthy materials to\nsettle, and evaporating the clear solution so obtained to\ncrystallization. The soluble impurities remain for the most part in the\nmother liquors.",
  "Since this salt is the only nitrate found extensively in nature, it is\nthe material from which other nitrates as well as nitric acid are\nprepared. It is used in enormous quantities in the manufacture of\nsulphuric acid and potassium nitrate, and as a fertilizer.",
  "~Sodium phosphate~ (Na_{2}HPO_{4}·12H_{2}O). Since phosphoric acid has\nthree replaceable hydrogen atoms, three sodium phosphates are\npossible,--two acid salts and one normal. All three can be made without\ndifficulty, but disodium phosphate is the only one which is largely\nused, and is the salt which is commonly called sodium phosphate. It is\nmade by the action of phosphoric acid on sodium carbonate:",
  "Na_{2}CO_{3} + H_{3}PO_{4} = Na_{2}HPO_{4} + CO_{2} + H_{2}O.",
  "It is interesting as being one of the few phosphates which are soluble\nin water, and is the salt commonly used when a soluble phosphate is\nneeded.",
  "~Normal sodium phosphate~ (Na_{3}PO_{4}). Although this is a normal salt\nits solution has a strongly alkaline reaction. This is due to the fact\nthat the salt hydrolyzes in solution into sodium hydroxide and disodium\nphosphate, as represented in the equation",
  "Na_{3}PO_{4} + H_{2}O = Na_{2}HPO_{4} + NaOH.",
  "Sodium hydroxide is strongly alkaline, while disodium phosphate is\nnearly neutral in reaction. The solution as a whole is therefore\nalkaline. The salt is prepared by adding a large excess of sodium\nhydroxide to a solution of disodium phosphate and evaporating to\ncrystallization. The excess of the sodium hydroxide reverses the\nreaction of hydrolysis and the normal salt crystallizes out.",
  "~Sodium tetraborate ~(_borax_) (Na_{2}B_{4}O_{7}·10H_{2}O). The properties\nof this important compound have been discussed under the head of boron.",
  "POTASSIUM",
  "~Occurrence in nature.~ Potassium is a constituent of many common rocks\nand minerals, and is therefore a rather abundant element, though not so\nabundant as sodium. Feldspar, which occurs both by itself and as a\nconstituent of granite, contains considerable potassium. The element is\na constituent of all clay and of mica and also occurs in very large\ndeposits at Stassfurt, Germany, in the form of the chloride and\nsulphate, associated with compounds of sodium and magnesium. In small\nquantities it is found as nitrate and in many other forms.",
  "The natural decomposition of rocks containing potassium gives rise to\nvarious compounds of the element in all fertile soils. Its soluble\ncompounds are absorbed by growing plants and built up into complex\nvegetable substances; when these are burned the potassium remains in the\nash in the form of the carbonate. Crude carbonate obtained from wood\nashes was formerly the chief source of potassium compounds; they are now\nmostly prepared from the salts of the Stassfurt deposits.",
  "~Stassfurt salts.~ These salts form very extensive deposits in\n     middle and north Germany, the most noted locality for working\n     them being at Stassfurt. The deposits are very thick and rest\n     upon an enormous layer of common salt. They are in the form of\n     a series of strata, each consisting largely of a single mineral\n     salt. A cross section of these deposits is shown in Fig. 78.\n     While these strata are salts from a chemical standpoint, they\n     are as solid and hard as many kinds of stone, and are mined as\n     stone or coal would be. Since the strata differ in general\n     appearance, each can be mined separately, and the various\n     minerals can be worked up by methods adapted to each particular\n     case. The chief minerals of commercial importance in these\n     deposits are the following:",
  "Sylvine       KCl.\n        Anhydrite     CaSO_{4}.\n        Carnallite    KCl·MgCl_{2}·6H_{2}O.\n        Kainite       K_{2}SO_{4}·MgSO_{4}·MgCl_{2}·6H_{2}O.\n        Polyhalite    K_{2}SO_{4}·MgSO_{4}·2CaSO_{4}·2H_{2}O.\n        Kieserite     MgSO_{4}·H_{2}O.\n        Schönite      K_{2}SO_{4}·MgSO_{4}·6H_{2}O.",
  "~Preparation and properties.~ The metal is prepared by the same method\nused in the preparation of sodium. In most respects it is very similar\nto sodium, the chief difference being that it is even more energetic in\nits action upon other substances. The freshly cut, bright surface\ninstantly becomes dim through oxidation by the air. It decomposes water\nvery vigorously, the heat of reaction being sufficient to ignite the\nhydrogen evolved. It is somewhat lighter than sodium and is preserved\nunder gasoline.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 78]",
  "~Potassium hydroxide~ (_caustic potash_) (KOH). Potassium hydroxide is\nprepared by methods exactly similar to those used in the preparation of\nsodium hydroxide, which compound it closely resembles in both physical\nand chemical properties. It is not used to any very great extent, being\nreplaced by the cheaper sodium hydroxide.",
  "~Action of the halogen elements on potassium hydroxide.~ When any one of\nthe three halogen elements--chlorine, bromine, and iodine--is added to a\nsolution of potassium hydroxide a reaction takes place, the nature of\nwhich depends upon the conditions of the experiment. Thus, when chlorine\nis passed into a cold dilute solution of potassium hydroxide the\nreaction expressed by the following equation takes place:",
  "(1) 2KOH + 2Cl = KCl + KClO + H_{2}O.",
  "If the solution of hydroxide is concentrated and hot, on the other hand,\nthe potassium hypochlorite formed according to equation (1) breaks down\nas fast as formed:",
  "(2) 3KClO = KClO_{3} + 2KCl.",
  "Equation (1), after being multiplied by 3, may be combined with equation\n(2), giving the following:",
  "(3) 6KOH + 6Cl = 5KCl + KClO_{3} + 3H_{2}O.",
  "This represents in a single equation the action of chlorine on hot,\nconcentrated solutions of potassium hydroxide. By means of these\nreactions one can prepare potassium chloride, potassium hypochlorite,\nand potassium chlorate. By substituting bromine or iodine for chlorine\nthe corresponding compounds of these elements are obtained. Some of\nthese compounds can be obtained in cheaper ways.",
  "If the halogen element is added to a solution of sodium hydroxide or\ncalcium hydroxide, the reaction which takes place is exactly similar to\nthat which takes place with potassium hydroxide. It is possible,\ntherefore, to prepare in this way the sodium and calcium compounds\ncorresponding to the potassium compounds given above.",
  "~Potassium chloride~ (KCl). This salt occurs in nature in sea water, in\nthe mineral sylvine, and, combined with magnesium chloride, as\ncarnallite (KCl·MgCl_{2}·6H_{2}O). It is prepared from carnallite by\nsaturating boiling water with the mineral and allowing the solution to\ncool. The mineral decomposes while in solution, and the potassium\nchloride crystallizes out on cooling, while the very soluble magnesium\nchloride remains in solution. The salt is very similar to sodium\nchloride both in physical and chemical properties. It is used in the\npreparation of nearly all other potassium salts, and, together with\npotassium sulphate, is used as a fertilizer.",
  "~Potassium bromide~ (KBr). When bromine is added to a hot concentrated\nsolution of potassium hydroxide there is formed a mixture of potassium\nbromide and potassium bromate in accordance with the reactions already\ndiscussed. There is no special use for the bromate, so the solution is\nevaporated to dryness, and the residue, consisting of a mixture of the\nbromate and bromide, is strongly heated. This changes the bromate to\nbromide, as follows:",
  "KBrO_{3} = KBr +3O.",
  "The bromide is then crystallized from water, forming large colorless\ncrystals. It is used in medicine and in photography.",
  "~Potassium iodide~ (KI). Potassium iodide may be made by exactly the same\nmethod as has just been described for the bromide, substituting iodine\nfor bromine. It is more frequently made as follows. Iron filings are\ntreated with iodine, forming the compound Fe_{3}I_{8}; on boiling this\nsubstance with potassium carbonate the reaction represented in the\nfollowing equation occurs:",
  "Fe_{3}I_{8} + 4K_{2}CO_{3} = Fe_{3}O_{4} + 8KI + 4CO_{2}.",
  "Potassium iodide finds its chief use in medicine.",
  "~Potassium chlorate~ (KClO_{3}). This salt, as has just been explained,\ncan be made by the action of chlorine on strong potassium hydroxide\nsolutions. The chief use of potassium chlorate is as an oxidizing agent\nin the manufacture of matches, fireworks, and explosives; it is also\nused in the preparation of oxygen and in medicine.",
  "~Commercial preparation.~ By referring to the reaction between\n     chlorine and hot concentrated solutions of potassium hydroxide,\n     it will be seen that only one molecule of potassium chlorate is\n     formed from six molecules of potassium hydroxide. Partly\n     because of this poor yield and partly because the potassium\n     hydroxide is rather expensive, this process is not an\n     economical one for the preparation of potassium chlorate. The\n     commercial method is the following. Chlorine is passed into hot\n     solutions of calcium hydroxide, a compound which is very cheap.\n     The resulting calcium chloride and chlorate are both very\n     soluble. To the solution of these salts potassium chloride is\n     added, and as the solution cools the sparingly soluble\n     potassium chlorate crystallizes out:",
  "Ca(ClO_{3})_{2} + 2KCl = 2KClO_{3} + CaCl_{2}.",
  "Electro-chemical processes are also used.",
  "~Potassium nitrate~ (_saltpeter_) (KNO_{3}). This salt was formerly made\nby allowing animal refuse to decompose in the open air in the presence\nof wood ashes or earthy materials containing potassium. Under these\nconditions the nitrogen in the organic matter is in part converted into\npotassium nitrate, which was obtained by extracting the mass with water\nand evaporating to crystallization. This crude and slow process is now\nalmost entirely replaced by a manufacturing process in which the\npotassium salt is made from Chili saltpeter:",
  "NaNO_{3} + KCl = NaCl + KNO_{3}.",
  "This process has been made possible by the discovery of the Chili niter\nbeds and the potassium chloride of the Stassfurt deposits.",
  "The reaction depends for its success upon the apparently\n     insignificant fact that sodium chloride is almost equally\n     soluble in cold and hot water. All four factors in the equation\n     are rather soluble in cold water, but in hot water sodium\n     chloride is far less soluble than the other three. When hot\n     saturated solutions of sodium nitrate and potassium chloride\n     are brought together, sodium chloride precipitates and can be\n     filtered off, leaving potassium nitrate in solution, together\n     with some sodium chloride. On cooling, potassium nitrate\n     crystallizes out, leaving small amounts of the other salts in\n     solution.",
  "Potassium nitrate is a colorless salt which forms very large crystals.\nIt is stable in the air, and when heated is a good oxidizing agent,\ngiving up oxygen quite readily. Its chief use is in the manufacture of\ngunpowder.",
  "~Gunpowder.~ The object sought for in the preparation of\n     gunpowder is to secure a solid substance which will remain\n     unchanged under ordinary conditions, but which will explode\n     readily when ignited, evolving a large volume of gas. When a\n     mixture of carbon and potassium nitrate is ignited a great deal\n     of gas is formed, as will be seen from the equation",
  "2KNO_{3} + 3C = CO_{2} + CO + N_{2} + K_{2}CO_{3}.",
  "By adding sulphur to the mixture the volume of gas formed in\n     the explosion is considerably increased:",
  "2KNO_{3} + 3C + S = 3CO_{2} + N_{2} + K_{2}S.",
  "Gunpowder is simply a mechanical mixture of these three\n     substances in the proportion required for the above reaction.\n     While the equation represents the principal reaction, other\n     reactions also take place. The gases formed in the explosion,\n     when measured under standard conditions, occupy about two\n     hundred and eighty times the volume of the original powder.\n     Potassium sulphide (K_{2}S) is a solid substance, and it is\n     largely due to it that gunpowder gives off smoke and soot when\n     it explodes. Smokeless powder consists of organic substances\n     which, on explosion, give only colorless gases, and hence\n     produce no smoke. Sodium nitrate is cheaper than potassium\n     nitrate, but it is not adapted to the manufacture of the best\n     grades of powder, since it is somewhat deliquescent and does\n     not give up its oxygen so readily as does potassium nitrate. It\n     is used, however, in the cheaper grades of powder, such as are\n     employed for blasting.",
  "~Potassium cyanide~ (KCN). When animal matter containing nitrogen is\nheated with iron and potassium carbonate, complicated changes occur\nwhich result in the formation of a substance commonly called yellow\nprussiate of potash, which has the formula K_{4}FeC_{6}N_{6}. When this\nsubstance is heated with potassium, potassium cyanide is formed:",
  "K_{4}FeC_{6}N_{6} + 2 K = 6KCN + Fe.",
  "Since sodium is much cheaper than potassium it is often used in place of\nit:",
  "K_{4}FeC_{6}N_{6} + 2Na = 4KCN + 2NaCN + Fe.",
  "The mixture of cyanides so resulting serves most of the purposes of the\npure salt. It is used very extensively in several metallurgical\nprocesses, particularly in the extraction of gold. Potassium cyanide is\na white solid characterized by its poisonous properties, and must be\nused with extreme caution.",
  "~Potassium carbonate~ (_potash_) (K_{2}CO_{3}). This compound occurs in\nwood ashes in small quantities. It cannot be prepared by the Solvay\nprocess, since the acid carbonate is quite soluble in water, but is made\nby the Le Blanc process. Its chief use is in the manufacture of other\npotassium salts.",
  "~Other salts of potassium.~ Among the other salts of potassium frequently\nmet with are the sulphate (K_{2}SO_{4}), the acid carbonate (KHCO_{3}),\nthe acid sulphate (KHSO_{4}), and the acid sulphite (KHSO_{3}). These\nare all white solids.",
  "LITHIUM, RUBIDIUM, CÆSIUM",
  "Of the three remaining elements of the family--lithium, rubidium, and\ncæsium--lithium is by far the most common, the other two being very\nrare. Lithium chloride and carbonate are not infrequently found in\nnatural mineral waters, and as these substances are supposed to increase\nthe medicinal value of the water, they are very often added to\nartificial mineral waters in small quantities.",
  "COMPOUNDS OF AMMONIUM",
  "~General.~ As explained in a previous chapter, when ammonia is passed into\nwater the two compounds combine to form the base NH_{4}OH, known as\nammonium hydroxide. When this base is neutralized with acids there are\nformed the corresponding salts, known as the ammonium salts. Since the\nammonium group is univalent, ammonium salts resemble those of the alkali\nmetals in formulas; they also resemble the latter salts very much in\ntheir chemical properties, and may be conveniently described in\nconnection with them. Among the ammonium salts the chloride, sulphate,\ncarbonate, and sulphide are the most familiar.",
  "~Ammonium chloride~ (_sal ammoniac_) (NH_{4}Cl). This substance is\nobtained by neutralizing ammonium hydroxide with hydrochloric acid. It\nis a colorless substance crystallizing in fine needles, and, like most\nammonium salts, is very soluble in water. When placed in a tube and\nheated strongly it decomposes into hydrochloric acid and ammonia. When\nthese gases reach a cooler portion of the tube they at once recombine,\nand the resulting ammonium chloride is deposited on the sides of the\ntube. In this way the salt can be separated from nonvolatile impurities.\nAmmonium chloride is sometimes used in preparation of ammonia; it is\nalso used in making dry batteries and in the laboratory as a chemical\nreagent.",
  "~Ammonium sulphate~ ((NH_{4})_{2}SO_{4}). This salt resembles the chloride\nvery closely, and, being cheaper, is used in place of it when possible.\nIt is used in large quantity as a fertilizer, the nitrogen which it\ncontains being a very valuable food for plants.",
  "~Ammonium carbonate~ ((NH_{4})_{2}CO_{3}). This salt, as well as the acid\ncarbonate (NH_{4}HCO_{3}), is used as a chemical reagent. They are\ncolorless solids, freely soluble in water. The normal carbonate is made\nby heating ammonium chloride with powdered limestone (calcium\ncarbonate), the ammonium carbonate being obtained as a sublimate in\ncompact hard masses:",
  "2NH_{4}Cl + CaCO_{3} = (NH_{4})_{2}CO_{3} + CaCl_{2}.",
  "The salt always smells of ammonia, since it slowly decomposes, as shown\nin the equation",
  "(NH_{4})_{2}CO_{3} = NH_{4}HCO_{3} + NH_{3}.",
  "The acid carbonate, or bicarbonate, is prepared by saturating a solution\nof ammonium hydroxide with carbon dioxide:",
  "NH_{4}OH + CO_{2} = NH_{4}HCO_{3}.",
  "It is a well-crystallized stable substance.",
  "~Ammonium sulphide~ ((NH_{4})_{2}S). Ammonium sulphide is prepared by the\naction of hydrosulphuric acid upon ammonium hydroxide:",
  "2NH_{4}OH + H_{2}S = (NH_{4})_{2}S + 2H_{2}O.",
  "If the action is allowed to continue until no more hydrosulphuric acid\nis absorbed, the product is the acid sulphide, sometimes called the\nhydrosulphide:",
  "NH_{4}OH + H_{2}S = NH_{4}HS + H_{2}O.",
  "If equal amounts of ammonium hydroxide and ammonium acid sulphide are\nbrought together, the normal sulphide is formed:",
  "NH_{4}OH + NH_{4}HS = (NH_{4})_{2}S + H_{2}O",
  "It has been obtained in the solid state, but only with great difficulty.\nAs used in the laboratory it is always in the form of a solution. It is\nmuch used in the process of chemical analysis because it is a soluble\nsulphide and easily prepared. On exposure to the air ammonium sulphide\nslowly decomposes, being converted into ammonia, water, and sulphur:",
  "(NH_{4})_{2}S + O = 2NH_{3} + H_{2}O + S.",
  "As fast as the sulphur is liberated it combines with the unchanged\nsulphide to form several different ammonium sulphides in which there are\nfrom two to five sulphur atoms in the molecule, thus: (NH_{4})_{2}S_{2},\n(NH_{4})_{2}S_{3}, (NH_{4})_{2}S_{5}. These sulphides in turn decompose\nby further action of oxygen, so that the final products of the reaction\nare those given in the equation. A solution of these compounds is yellow\nand is sometimes called _yellow ammonium sulphide_.",
  "FLAME REACTION--SPECTROSCOPE",
  "When compounds of either sodium or potassium are brought into\n     the non-luminous flame of a Bunsen burner the flame becomes\n     colored. Sodium compounds color it intensely yellow, while\n     those of potassium color it pale violet. When only one of these\n     elements is present it is easy to identify it by this simple\n     test, but when both are present the intense color of the sodium\n     flame entirely conceals the pale tint characteristic of\n     potassium compounds.",
  "It is possible to detect the potassium flame in such cases,\n     however, in the following way. When light is allowed to shine\n     through a very small hole or slit in some kind of a screen,\n     such as a piece of metal, upon a triangular prism of glass, the\n     light is bent or refracted out of its course instead of passing\n     straight through the glass. It thus comes out of the prism at\n     some angle to the line at which it entered. Yellow light is\n     bent more than red, and violet more than yellow. When light\n     made up of the yellow of sodium and the violet of potassium\n     shines through a slit upon such a prism, the yellow and the\n     violet lights come out at somewhat different angles, and so two\n     colored lines of light--a yellow line and a violet line--are\n     seen on looking into the prism in the proper direction. The\n     instrument used for separating the rays of light in this way is\n     called a _spectroscope_ (Fig. 79). The material to be tested is\n     placed on a platinum wire and held in the colorless Bunsen\n     flame. The resulting light passes through the slit in the end\n     of tube B, and then through B to the prism. The resulting\n     lines of light are seen by looking into the tube A, which\n     contains a magnifying lens. Most elements give more than one\n     image of the slit, each having a different color, and the\n     series of colored lines due to an element is called its\n     spectrum.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 79]",
  "The spectra of the known elements have been carefully studied, and any\nelement which imparts a characteristic color to a flame, or has a\nspectrum of its own, can be identified even when other elements are\npresent. Through the spectroscopic examination of certain minerals a\nnumber of elements have been discovered by the observation of lines\nwhich did not belong to any known element. A study of the substance then\nbrought to light the new element. Rubidium and cæsium were discovered in\nthis way, rubidium having bright red lines and cæsium a very intense\nblue line. Lithium colors the flame deep red, and has a bright red line\nin its spectrum.",

  "~The family.~ The alkaline-earth family consists of the very abundant\nelement calcium and the much rarer elements strontium and barium. They\nare called the alkaline-earth metals because their properties are\nbetween those of the alkali metals and the earth metals. The earth\nmetals will be discussed in a later chapter. The family is also\nfrequently called the calcium family.",
  "1. _Occurrence._ These elements do not occur free in nature. Their most\nabundant compounds are the carbonates and sulphates; calcium also occurs\nin large quantities as the phosphate and silicate.",
  "2. _Preparation._ The metals were first prepared by Davy in 1808 by\nelectrolysis. This method has again come into use in recent years.\nStrontium and barium have as yet been obtained only in small quantities\nand in the impure state, and many of their physical properties, such as\ntheir densities and melting points, are therefore imperfectly known.",
  "3. _Properties._ The three metals resemble each other very closely. They\nare silvery-white in color and are about as hard as lead. Their\ndensities increase with their atomic weights, as is shown in the table\non opposite page. Like the alkali metals they have a strong affinity for\noxygen, tarnishing in the air through oxidation. They decompose water at\nordinary temperatures, forming hydroxides and liberating hydrogen. When\nignited in the air they burn with brilliancy, forming oxides of the\ngeneral formula MO. These oxides readily combine with water, according\nto the equation",
  "MO + H_{2}O = M(OH)_{2}.",
  "Each of the elements has a characteristic spectrum, and the presence of\nthe metals can easily be detected by the spectroscope.",
  "4. _Compounds._ The elements are divalent in almost all of their\ncompounds, and these compounds in solution give simple, divalent,\ncolorless ions. The corresponding salts of the three elements are very\nsimilar to each other and show a regular variation in properties in\npassing from calcium to strontium and from strontium to barium. This is\nseen in the solubility of the sulphate and hydroxide, and in the ease of\ndecomposition of the carbonates, as given in the table. Unlike the\nalkali metals, their normal carbonates and phosphates are insoluble in\nwater.",
  "CALCIUM",
  "~Occurrence.~ The compounds of calcium are very abundant in nature, so\nthat the total amount of calcium in the earth's crust is very large. A\ngreat many different compounds containing the clement are known, the\nmost important of which are the following:",
  "Calcite (marble)     CaCO_{3}.\n    Phosphorite          Ca_{3}(PO_{4})_{2}.\n    Fluorspar            CaF_{2}.\n    Wollastonite         CaSiO_{3}.\n    Gypsum               CaSO_{4}·2H_{2}O.\n    Anhydrite            CaSO_{4}.",
  "~Preparation.~ Calcium is now prepared by the electrolysis of the melted\nchloride, the metal depositing in solid condition on the cathode. It is\na gray metal, considerably heavier and harder than sodium. It acts upon\nwater, forming calcium hydroxide and hydrogen, but the action does not\nevolve sufficient heat to melt the metal. It promises to become a useful\nsubstance, though no commercial applications for it have as yet been\nfound.",
  "~Calcium oxide~ (_lime, quicklime_) (CaO). Lime is prepared by strongly\nheating calcium carbonate (limestone) in large furnaces called kilns:",
  "CaCO_{3} = CaO + CO_{2}.",
  "When pure, lime is a white amorphous substance. Heated intensely, as in\nthe oxyhydrogen flame, it gives a brilliant light called the lime light.\nAlthough it is a very difficultly fusible substance, yet in the electric\nfurnace it can be made to melt and even boil. Water acts upon lime with\nthe evolution of a great deal of heat,--hence the name quicklime, or\nlive lime,--the process being called slaking. The equation is",
  "CaO + H_{2}O = Ca(OH)_{2}.",
  "Lime readily absorbs moisture from the air, and is used to dry moist\ngases, especially ammonia, which cannot be dried by the usual\ndesiccating agents. It also absorbs carbon dioxide, forming the\ncarbonate",
  "CaO + CO_{2} = CaCO_{3}.",
  "Lime exposed to air is therefore gradually converted into hydroxide and\ncarbonate, and will no longer slake with water. It is then said to be\nair-slaked.",
  "~Limekilns.~ The older kiln, still in common use, consists of a\n     large cylindrical stack in which the limestone is loosely\n     packed. A fire is built at the base of the stack, and when the\n     burning is complete it is allowed to die out and the lime is\n     removed from the kiln. The newer kilns are constructed as shown\n     in Fig. 80. A number of fire boxes are built around the lower\n     part of the kiln, one of which is shown at B. The fire is\n     built on the grate F and the hot products of combustion are\n     drawn up through the stack, decomposing the limestone. The kiln\n     is charged at C, and sometimes fuel is added with the\n     limestone to cause combustion throughout the contents of the\n     kiln. The burned lime is raked out through openings in the\n     bottom of the stack, one of which is shown at _D._ The\n     advantage of this kind of a kiln over the older form is that\n     the process is continuous, limestone being charged in at the\n     top as fast as the lime is removed at the bottom.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 80]",
  "~Calcium hydroxide ~ (_slaked lime_) (Ca(OH)_{2}). Pure calcium hydroxide\nis a light white powder. It is sparingly soluble in water, forming a\nsolution called _limewater_, which is often used in medicine as a mild\nalkali. Chemically, calcium hydroxide is a moderately strong base,\nthough not so strong as sodium hydroxide. Owing to its cheapness it is\nmuch used in the industries whenever an alkali is desired. A number of\nits uses have already been mentioned. It is used in the preparation of\nammonia, bleaching powder, and potassium hydroxide. It is also used to\nremove carbon dioxide and sulphur compounds from coal gas, to remove the\nhair from hides in the tanneries (this recalls the caustic or corrosive\nproperties of sodium hydroxide), and for making mortar.",
  "~Mortar~ is a mixture of calcium hydroxide and sand. When it is exposed to\nthe air or spread upon porous materials moisture is removed from it\npartly by absorption in the porous materials and partly by evaporation,\nand the mortar becomes firm, or _sets_. At the same time carbon dioxide\nis slowly absorbed from the air, forming hard calcium carbonate:",
  "Ca(OH)_{2} + CO_{2} = CaCO_{3} + H_{2}O.",
  "By this combined action the mortar becomes very hard and adheres firmly\nto the surface upon which it is spread. The sand serves to give body to\nthe mortar and makes it porous, so that the change into carbonate can\ntake place throughout the mass. It also prevents too much shrinkage.",
  "~Cement.~ When limestone to which clay and sand have been added in certain\nproportions is burned until it is partly fused (some natural marl is\nalready of about the right composition), and the clinker so produced is\nground to powder, the product is called cement. When this material is\nmoistened it sets to a hard stone-like mass which retains its hardness\neven when exposed to the continued action of water. It can be used for\nunder-water work, such as bridge piers, where mortar would quickly\nsoften. Several varieties of cement are made, the best known of which is\nPortland cement.",
  "~Growing importance of cement.~ Cement is rapidly coming into use for a\ngreat variety of purposes. It is often used in place of mortar in the\nconstruction of brick buildings. Mixed with crushed stone and sand it\nforms concrete which is used in foundation work. It is also used in\nmaking artificial stone, terra-cotta trimmings for buildings, artificial\nstone walks and floors, and the like. It is being used more and more for\nmaking many articles which were formerly made of wood or stone, and the\nentire walls of buildings are sometimes made of cement blocks or of\nconcrete.",
  "~Calcium carbonate~ (CaCO_{3}). This substance is found in a great many\nnatural forms to which various names have been given. They may be\nclassified under three heads:",
  "1. _Amorphous carbonate._ This includes those forms which are not\nmarkedly crystalline. Limestone is the most familiar of these and is a\ngrayish rock usually found in hard stratified masses. Whole mountain\nranges are sometimes made up of this material. It is always impure,\nusually containing magnesium carbonate, clay, silica, iron and aluminium\ncompounds, and frequently fossil remains. Marl is a mixture of limestone\nand clay. Pearls, chalk, coral, and shells are largely calcium\ncarbonate.",
  "2. _Hexagonal carbonate._ Calcium carbonate crystallizes in the form of\nrhomb-shaped crystals which belong to the hexagonal system. When very\npure and transparent the substance is called Iceland spar. Calcite is a\nsimilar form, but somewhat opaque or clouded. Mexican onyx is a massive\nvariety, streaked or banded with colors due to impurities. Marble when\npure is made up of minute calcite crystals. Stalactites and stalagmites\nare icicle-like forms sometimes found in caves.",
  "3. _Rhombic carbonate._ Calcium carbonate sometimes crystallizes in\nneedle-shaped crystals belonging to the rhombic system. This is the\nunstable form and tends to go over into the other variety. Aragonite is\nthe most familiar example of this form.",
  "~Preparation and uses of calcium carbonate.~ In the laboratory pure\ncalcium carbonate can be prepared by treating a soluble calcium salt\nwith a soluble carbonate:",
  "Na_{2}CO_{3} + CaCl_{2} = CaCO_{3} + 2NaCl.",
  "When prepared in this way it is a soft white powder often called\nprecipitated chalk, and is much used as a polishing powder. It is\ninsoluble in water, but dissolves in water saturated with carbon\ndioxide, owing to the formation of the acid calcium carbonate which is\nslightly soluble:",
  "CaCO_{3} + H_{2}CO_{3} = Ca(HCO_{3})_{2}.",
  "The natural varieties of calcium carbonate find many uses, such as in\nthe preparation of lime and carbon dioxide; in metallurgical operations,\nespecially in the blast furnaces; in the manufacture of soda, glass, and\ncrayon (which, in addition to chalk, usually contains clay and calcium\nsulphate); for building stone and ballast for roads.",
  "~Calcium chloride~ (CaCl_{2}). This salt occurs in considerable quantity\nin sea water. It is obtained as a by-product in many technical\nprocesses, as in the Solvay soda process. When crystallized from its\nsaturated solutions it forms colorless needles of the composition\nCaCl_{2}·6H_{2}O. By evaporating a solution to dryness and heating to a\nmoderate temperature calcium chloride is obtained anhydrous as a white\nporous mass. In this condition it absorbs water with great energy and is\na valuable drying agent.",
  "~Bleaching powder~ (CaOCl_{2}). When chlorine acts upon a solution of\ncalcium hydroxide the reaction is similar to that which occurs between\nchlorine and potassium hydroxide:",
  "2 Ca(OH)_{2} + 4 Cl = CaCl_{2} + Ca(ClO)_{2} + 2 H_{2}O.",
  "If, however, chlorine is conducted over calcium hydroxide in the form of\na dry powder, it is absorbed and a substance is formed which appears to\nhave the composition represented in the formula CaOCl_{2}. This\nsubstance is called bleaching powder, or hypochlorite of lime. It is\nprobably the calcium salt of both hydrochloric and hypochlorous acids,\nso that its structure is represented by the formula",
  "/ClO\n    Ca\n       \\Cl.",
  "In solution this substance acts exactly like a mixture of calcium\nchloride (CaCl_{2}) and calcium hypochlorite (Ca(ClO)_{2}), since it\ndissociates to form the ions Ca^{++}, Cl^{-}, and ClO^{-}.",
  "Bleaching powder undergoes a number of reactions which make it an\nimportant substance.",
  "1. When treated with an acid it evolves chlorine:",
  "/ClO\n    Ca + H_{2}SO_{4} = CaSO_{4} + HCl + HClO,\n      \\Cl",
  "HCl + HClO = H_{2}O + 2Cl.",
  "This reaction can be employed in the preparation of chlorine, or the\nnascent chlorine may be used as a bleaching agent.",
  "2. It is slowly decomposed by the carbon dioxide of the air, yielding\ncalcium carbonate and chlorine:",
  "CaOCl_{2} + CO_{2} = CaCO_{3} + 2Cl.",
  "Owing to this slow action the substance is a good disinfectant.",
  "3. When its solution is boiled the substance breaks down into calcium\nchloride and chlorate:",
  "6CaOCl_{2} = 5CaCl_{2} + Ca(ClO_{3})_{2}.",
  "This reaction is used in the preparation of potassium chlorate.",
  "~Calcium fluoride~ (_fluorspar_) (CaF_{2}). Fluorspar has already been\nmentioned as the chief natural compound of fluorine. It is found in\nlarge quantities in a number of localities, and is often crystallized in\nperfect cubes of a light green or amethyst color. It can be melted\neasily in a furnace, and is sometimes used in the fused condition in\nmetallurgical operations to protect a metal from the action of the air\nduring its reduction. It is used as the chief source of fluorine\ncompounds, especially hydrofluoric acid.",
  "~Calcium sulphate~ (_gypsum_) (CaSO_{4}·2H_{2}O). This abundant substance\noccurs in very perfectly formed crystals or in massive deposits. It is\noften found in solution in natural waters and in the sea water. Salts\ndeposited from sea water are therefore likely to contain this substance\n(see Stassfurt salts).",
  "It is very sparingly soluble in water, and is thrown down as a fine\nwhite precipitate when any considerable amounts of a calcium salt and a\nsoluble sulphate (or sulphuric acid) are brought together in solution.\nIts chief use is in the manufacture of plaster of Paris and of hollow\ntiles for fireproof walls. Such material is called _gypsite_. It is also\nused as a fertilizer.",
  "Calcium sulphate, like the carbonate, occurs in many forms in nature.\nGypsum is a name given to all common varieties. Granular or massive\nspecimens are called alabaster, while all those which are well\ncrystallized are called selenite. Satin spar is still another variety\noften seen in mineral collections.",
  "~Plaster of Paris.~ When gypsum is heated to about 115° it loses a portion\nof its water of crystallization in accordance with the equation",
  "2(CaSO_{4}·2H_{2}O) = 2CaSO_{4}·H_{2}O + 2H_{2}O.",
  "The product is a fine white powder called _plaster of Paris_. On being\nmoistened it again takes up this water, and in so doing first forms a\nplastic mass, which soon becomes very firm and hard and regains its\ncrystalline structure. These properties make it very valuable as a\nmaterial for forming casts and stucco work, for cementing glass to\nmetals, and for other similar purposes. If overheated so that all water\nis driven off, the process of taking up water is so slow that the\nmaterial is worthless. Such material is said to be dead burned. Plaster\nof Paris is very extensively used as the finishing coat for plastered\nwalls.",
  "~Hard water.~ Waters containing compounds of calcium and magnesium in\nsolution are called hard waters because they feel harsh to the touch.\nThe hardness of water may be of two kinds,--(1) temporary hardness and\n(2) permanent hardness.",
  "1. _Temporary hardness._ We have seen that when water charged with\ncarbon dioxide comes in contact with limestone a certain amount of the\nlatter dissolves, owing to the formation of the soluble acid carbonate\nof calcium. The hardness of such waters is said to be temporary, since\nit may be removed by boiling. The heat changes the acid carbonate into\nthe insoluble normal carbonate which then precipitates, rendering the\nwater soft:",
  "Ca(HCO_{3})_{2} = CaCO_{3} + H_{2}O + CO_{2}.",
  "Such waters may also be softened by the addition of sufficient lime or\ncalcium hydroxide to convert the acid carbonate of calcium into the\nnormal carbonate. The equation representing the reaction is",
  "Ca(HCO_{3})_{2} + Ca(OH)_{2} = 2CaCO_{3} + 2H_{2}O.",
  "2. _Permanent hardness._ The hardness of water may also be due to the\npresence of calcium and magnesium sulphates or chlorides. Boiling the\nwater does not affect these salts; hence such waters are said to have\npermanent hardness. They may be softened, however, by the addition of\nsodium carbonate, which precipitates the calcium and magnesium as\ninsoluble carbonates:",
  "CaSO_{4} + Na_{2}CO_{3} = CaCO_{3} + Na_{2}SO_{4}.",
  "This process is sometimes called \"breaking\" the water.",
  "~Commercial methods for softening water.~ The average water of a\n     city supply contains not only the acid carbonates of calcium\n     and magnesium but also the sulphates and chlorides of these\n     metals, together with other salts in smaller quantities. Such\n     waters are softened on a commercial scale by the addition of\n     the proper quantities of calcium hydroxide and sodium\n     carbonate. The calcium hydroxide is added first to precipitate\n     all the acid carbonates. After a short time the sodium\n     carbonate is added to precipitate the other soluble salts of\n     calcium and magnesium, together with any excess of calcium\n     hydroxide which may have been added. The quantity of calcium\n     hydroxide and sodium carbonate required is calculated from a\n     chemical analysis of the water. It will be noticed that the\n     water softened in this way will contain sodium sulphate and\n     chloride, but the presence of these salts is not objectionable.",
  "~Calcium carbide~ (CaC_{2}). This substance is made by heating well-dried\ncoke and lime in an electrical furnace. The equation is",
  "CaO + 3C = CaC_{2} + CO.",
  "The pure carbide is a colorless, transparent, crystalline substance. In\ncontact with water it is decomposed with the evolution of pure acetylene\ngas, having a pleasant ethereal odor. The commercial article is a dull\ngray porous substance which contains many impurities. The acetylene\nprepared from this substance has a very characteristic odor due to\nimpurities, the chief of these being phosphine. It is used in\nconsiderable quantities as a source of acetylene gas for illuminating\npurposes.",
  "~Technical preparation.~ Fig. 81 represents a recent type of a\n     carbide furnace. The base of the furnace is provided with a\n     large block of carbon A, which serves as one of the\n     electrodes. The other electrodes B, several in number, are\n     arranged horizontally at some distance above this. A mixture of\n     coal and lime is fed into the furnace through the trap top C,\n     and in the lower part of the furnace this mixture becomes\n     intensely heated, forming liquid carbide. This is drawn off\n     through the taphole D.",
  "The carbon monoxide formed in the reaction escapes through the\n     pipes E and is led back into the furnace. The pipes F\n     supply air, so that the monoxide burns as it reënters the\n     furnace and assists in heating the charge. The carbon dioxide\n     so formed, together with the nitrogen entering as air, escape\n     at G. An alternating current is used.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 81]",
  "~Calcium phosphate~ (Ca_{3}(PO_{4})_{2}). This important substance\noccurs abundantly in nature as a constituent of apatite\n(3Ca_{3}(PO_{4})_{2}·CaF_{2}), in phosphate rock, and as the chief\nmineral constituent of bones. Bone ash is therefore nearly pure calcium\nphosphate. It is a white powder, insoluble in water, although it readily\ndissolves in acids, being decomposed by them and converted into soluble\nacid phosphates, as explained in connection with the acids of\nphosphorus.",
  "STRONTIUM",
  "~Occurrence.~ Strontium occurs sparingly in nature, usually as\nstrontianite (SrCO_{3}) and as celestite (SrSO_{4}). Both minerals form\nbeautiful colorless crystals, though celestite is sometimes colored a\nfaint blue. Only a few of the compounds of strontium have any commercial\napplications.",
  "~Strontium hydroxide~ (Sr(OH)_{2}·8H_{2}O). The method of preparation of\nstrontium hydroxide is analogous to that of calcium hydroxide. The\nsubstance has the property of forming an insoluble compound with sugar,\nwhich can easily be separated again into its constituents. It is\ntherefore sometimes used in the sugar refineries to extract sugar from\nimpure mother liquors from which the sugar will not crystallize.",
  "~Strontium nitrate~ (Sr(NO_{3})_{2}·4H_{2}O). This salt is prepared by\ntreating the native carbonate with nitric acid. When ignited with\ncombustible materials it imparts a brilliant crimson color to the flame,\nand because of this property it is used in the manufacture of red\nlights.",
  "BARIUM",
  "Barium is somewhat more abundant than strontium, occurring in nature\nlargely as barytes, or heavy spar (BaSO_{4}), and witherite (BaCO_{3}).\nLike strontium, it closely resembles calcium both in the properties of\nthe metal and in the compounds which it forms.",
  "~Oxides of barium.~ Barium oxide (BaO) can be obtained by strongly heating\nthe nitrate:",
  "Ba(NO_{3})_{2} = BaO + 2NO_{2} + O.",
  "Heated to a low red heat in the air, the oxide combines with oxygen,\nforming the peroxide (BaO_{2}). If the temperature is raised still\nhigher, or the pressure is reduced, oxygen is given off and the oxide is\nonce more formed. The reaction",
  "BaO_{2} <--> BaO + O",
  "is reversible and has been used as a means of separating oxygen from the\nair. Treated with acids, barium peroxide yields hydrogen peroxide:",
  "BaO_{2} + 2HCl = BaCl_{2} + H_{2}O_{2}.",
  "~Barium chloride~ (BaCl_{2}·2H_{2}O). Barium chloride is a white\nwell-crystallized substance which is easily prepared from the native\ncarbonate. It is largely used in the laboratory as a reagent to detect\nthe presence of sulphuric acid or soluble sulphates.",
  "~Barium sulphate~ _(barytes)_ (BaSO_{4}). Barium sulphate occurs in nature\nin the form of heavy white crystals. It is precipitated as a crystalline\npowder when a barium salt is added to a solution of a sulphate or\nsulphuric acid:",
  "BaCl_{2} + H_{2}SO_{4} = BaSO_{4} + 2HCl.",
  "This precipitate is used, as are also the finely ground native sulphate\nand carbonate, as a pigment in paints. On account of its low cost it is\nsometimes used as an adulterant of white lead, which is also a heavy\nwhite substance.",
  "Barium compounds color the flame green, and the nitrate (Ba(NO_{3})_{2})\nis used in the manufacture of green lights. Soluble barium compounds are\npoisonous.",
  "RADIUM",
  "~Historical.~ In 1896 the French scientist Becquerel observed that the\nmineral pitchblende possesses certain remarkable properties. It affects\nphotographic plates even in complete darkness, and discharges a\ngold-leaf electroscope when brought close to it. In 1898 Madam Curie\nmade a careful study of pitchblende to see if these properties belong to\nit or to some unknown substance contained in it. She succeeded in\nextracting from it a very small quantity of a substance containing a new\nelement which she named radium.",
  "In 1910 Madam Curie succeeded in obtaining radium itself by the\nelectrolysis of radium chloride. It is a silver-white metal melting at\nabout 700°. It blackens in the air, forming a nitride, and decomposes\nwater. Its atomic weight is about 226.5.",
  "~Properties.~ Compounds of radium affect a photographic plate or\nelectroscope even through layers of paper or sheets of metal. They also\nbring about chemical changes in substances placed near them.\nInvestigation of these strange properties has suggested that the radium\natoms are unstable and undergo a decomposition. As a result of this\ndecomposition very minute bodies, to which the name corpuscles has been\ngiven, are projected from the radium atom with exceedingly great\nvelocity. It is to these corpuscles that the strange properties of\nradium are due. It seems probable that the gas helium is in some way\nformed during the decomposition of radium.",
  "Two or three other elements, particularly uranium and thorium, have been\nfound to possess many of the properties of radium in smaller degree.",
  "~Radium and the atomic theory.~ If these views in regard to radium should\nprove to be well founded, it will be necessary to modify in some\nrespects the conception of the atom as developed in a former chapter.\nThe atom would have to be regarded as a compound unit made up of several\nparts. In a few cases, as in radium and uranium, it would appear that\nthis unit is unstable and undergoes transformation into more stable\ncombinations. This modification would not, in any essential way, be at\nvariance with the atomic theory as propounded by Dalton.",

  "~The family.~ In the magnesium family are included the four elements:\nmagnesium, zinc, cadmium, and mercury. Between the first three of these\nmetals there is a close family resemblance, such as has been traced\nbetween the members of the two preceding families. Mercury in some\nrespects is more similar to copper and will be studied in connection\nwith that metal.",
  "1. _Properties._ When heated to a high temperature in the air each of\nthese metals combines with oxygen to form an oxide of the general\nformula MO, in which M represents the metal. Magnesium decomposes\nboiling water slowly, while zinc and cadmium have but little action on\nit.",
  "2. _Compounds._ The members of this group are divalent in nearly all\ntheir compounds, so that the formulas of their salts resemble those of\nthe alkaline-earth metals. Like the alkaline-earth metals, their\ncarbonates and phosphates are insoluble in water. Their sulphates,\nhowever, are readily soluble. Unlike both the alkali and alkaline-earth\nmetals, their hydroxides are nearly insoluble in water. Most of their\ncompounds dissociate in such a way as to give a simple, colorless,\nmetallic ion.",
  "MAGNESIUM",
  "~Occurrence.~ Magnesium is a very abundant element in nature, ranking a\nlittle below calcium in this respect. Like calcium, it is a constituent\nof many rocks and also occurs in the form of soluble salts.",
  "~Preparation.~ The metal magnesium, like most metals whose oxides are\ndifficult to reduce with carbon, was formerly prepared by heating the\nanhydrous chloride with sodium:",
  "MgCl_{2} + 2Na = 2NaCl + Mg.",
  "It is now made by electrolysis, but instead of using as the electrolyte\nthe melted anhydrous chloride, which is difficult to obtain, the natural\nmineral carnallite is used. This is melted in an iron pot which also\nserves as the cathode in the electrolysis. A rod of carbon dipping into\nthe melted salt serves as the anode. The apparatus is very similar to\nthe one employed in the preparation of sodium.",
  "~Properties.~ Magnesium is a rather tough silvery-white metal of small\ndensity. Air does not act rapidly upon it, but a thin film of oxide\nforms upon its surface, dimming its bright luster. The common acids\ndissolve it with the formation of the corresponding salts. It can be\nignited readily and in burning liberates much heat and gives a brilliant\nwhite light. This light is very rich in the rays which affect\nphotographic plates, and the metal in the form of fine powder is\nextensively used in the production of flash lights and for white lights\nin pyrotechnic displays.",
  "~Magnesium oxide~ (_magnesia_) (MgO). Magnesium oxide, sometimes called\nmagnesia or magnesia usta, resembles lime in many respects. It is much\nmore easily formed than lime and can be made in the same way,--by\nigniting the carbonate. It is a white powder, very soft and light, and\nis unchanged by heat even at very high temperatures. For this reason it\nis used in the manufacture of crucibles, for lining furnaces, and for\nother purposes where a refractory substance is needed. It combines with\nwater to form magnesium hydroxide, but much more slowly and with the\nproduction of much less heat than in the case of calcium oxide.",
  "~Magnesium hydroxide~ (Mg(OH)_{2}). The hydroxide formed in this way is\nvery slightly soluble in water, but enough dissolves to give the water\nan alkaline reaction. Magnesium hydroxide is therefore a fairly strong\nbase. It is an amorphous white substance. Neither magnesia nor magnesium\nsalts have a very marked effect upon the system; and for this reason\nmagnesia is a very suitable antidote for poisoning by strong acids,\nsince any excess introduced into the system will have no injurious\neffect.",
  "~Magnesium cement.~ A paste of magnesium hydroxide and water\n     slowly absorbs carbon dioxide from the air and becomes very\n     hard. The hardness of the product is increased by the presence\n     of a considerable amount of magnesium chloride in the paste.\n     The hydroxide, with or without the chloride, is used in the\n     preparation of cements for some purposes.",
  "~Magnesium carbonate~ (MgCO_{3}). Magnesium carbonate is a very abundant\nmineral. It occurs in a number of localities as magnesite, which is\nusually amorphous, but sometimes forms pure crystals resembling calcite.\nMore commonly it is found associated with calcium carbonate. The\nmineral dolomite has the composition CaCO_{3}·MgCO_{3}. Limestone\ncontaining smaller amounts of magnesium carbonate is known as dolomitic\nlimestone. Dolomite is one of the most common rocks, forming whole\nmountain masses. It is harder and less readily attacked by acids than\nlimestone. It is valuable as a building stone and as ballast for\nroadbeds and foundations. Like calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate is\ninsoluble in water, though easily dissolved by acids.",
  "~Basic carbonate of magnesium.~ We should expect to find magnesium\ncarbonate precipitated when a soluble magnesium salt and a soluble\ncarbonate are brought together:",
  "Na_{2}CO_{3} + MgCl_{2} = MgCO_{3} + 2NaCl.",
  "Instead of this, some carbon dioxide escapes and the product is found to\nbe a basic carbonate. The most common basic carbonate of magnesium has\nthe formula 4MgCO_{3}·Mg(OH)_{2}, and is sometimes called magnesia alba.\nThis compound is formed by the partial hydrolysis of the normal\ncarbonate at first precipitated:",
  "5MgCO_{3} + 2H_{2}O = 4MgCO_{3}·Mg(OH)_{2} + H_{2}CO_{3}.",
  "~Magnesium chloride~ (MgCl_{2}·6H_{2}O). Magnesium chloride is found in\nmany natural waters and in many salt deposits (see Stassfurt salts). It\nis obtained as a by-product in the manufacture of potassium chloride\nfrom carnallite. As there is no very important use for it, large\nquantities annually go to waste. When heated to drive off the water of\ncrystallization the chloride is decomposed as shown in the equation",
  "MgCl_{2}·6H_{2}O = MgO + 2HCl + 5H_{2}O.",
  "Owing to the abundance of magnesium chloride, this reaction is being\nused to some extent in the preparation of both magnesium oxide and\nhydrochloric acid.",
  "~Boiler scale.~ When water which contains certain salts in\n     solution is evaporated in steam boilers, a hard insoluble\n     material called _scale_ deposits in the boiler. The formation\n     of this scale may be due to several distinct causes.",
  "1. _To the deposit of calcium sulphate._ This salt, while\n     sparingly soluble in cold water, is almost completely insoluble\n     in superheated water. Consequently it is precipitated when\n     water containing it is heated in a boiler.",
  "2. _To decomposition of acid carbonates._ As we have seen,\n     calcium and magnesium acid carbonates are decomposed on\n     heating, forming insoluble normal carbonates:",
  "Ca(HCO_{3})_{2} = CaCO_{3} + H_{2}O + CO_{2}.",
  "3. _To hydrolysis of magnesium salts._ Magnesium chloride, and\n     to some extent magnesium sulphate, undergo hydrolysis when\n     superheated in solution, and the magnesium hydroxide, being\n     sparingly soluble, precipitates:",
  "MgCl_{2} + 2H_{2}O <--> Mg(OH)_{2} + 2HCl.",
  "This scale adheres tightly to the boiler in compact layers and,\n     being a non-conductor of heat, causes much waste of fuel. It is\n     very difficult to remove, owing to its hardness and resistance\n     to reagents. Thick scale sometimes cracks, and the water coming\n     in contact with the overheated iron occasions an explosion.\n     Moreover, the acids set free in the hydrolysis of the magnesium\n     salts attack the iron tubes and rapidly corrode them. These\n     causes combine to make the formation of scale a matter which\n     occasions much trouble in cases where hard water is used in\n     steam boilers. Water containing such salts should be softened,\n     therefore, before being used in boilers.",
  "~Magnesium sulphate~ (_Epsom salt_) (MgSO_{4}·7H_{2}O). Like the chloride,\nmagnesium sulphate is found rather commonly in springs and in salt\ndeposits. A very large deposit of the almost pure salt has been found in\nWyoming. Its name was given to it because of its abundant occurrence in\nthe waters of the Epsom springs in England.",
  "Magnesium sulphate has many uses in the industries. It is used to a\nsmall extent in the preparation of sodium and potassium sulphates, as a\ncoating for cotton cloth, in the dye industry, in tanning, and in the\nmanufacture of paints and laundry soaps. To some extent it is used in\nmedicine.",
  "~Magnesium silicates.~ Many silicates containing magnesium are known and\nsome of them are important substances. Serpentine, asbestos, talc, and\nmeerschaum are examples of such substances.",
  "ZINC",
  "~Occurrence.~ Zinc never occurs free in nature. Its compounds have been\nfound in many different countries, but it is not a constituent of common\nrocks and minerals, and its occurrence is rather local and confined to\ndefinite deposits or pockets. It occurs chiefly in the following ores:",
  "Sphalerite (zinc blende) ZnS.\n    Zincite ZnO.\n    Smithsonite ZnCO_{3}.\n    Willemite Zn_{2}SiO_{4}.\n    Franklinite ZnO·Fe_{2}O_{3}.",
  "One fourth of the world's output of zinc comes from the United States,\nMissouri being the largest producer.",
  "~Metallurgy.~ The ores employed in the preparation of zinc are chiefly the\nsulphide, oxide, and carbonate. They are first roasted in the air, by\nwhich process they are changed into oxide:",
  "ZnCO_{3} = ZnO + CO_{2},\n    ZnS + 3O = ZnO + SO_{2}.",
  "The oxide is then mixed with coal dust, and the mixture is heated in\nearthenware muffles or retorts, natural gas being used as fuel in many\ncases. The oxide is reduced by this means to the metallic state, and the\nzinc, being volatile at the high temperature reached, distills and is\ncollected in suitable receivers. At first the zinc collects in the form\nof fine powder, called zinc dust or flowers of zinc, recalling the\nformation under similar conditions of flowers of sulphur. Later, when\nthe whole apparatus has become warm, the zinc condenses to a liquid in\nthe receiver, from which it is drawn off into molds. Commercial zinc\noften contains a number of impurities, especially carbon, arsenic, and\niron.",
  "~Physical properties.~ Pure zinc is a rather heavy bluish-white metal with\na high luster. It melts at about 420°, and if heated much above this\ntemperature in the air takes fire and burns with a very bright bluish\nflame. It boils at about 950° and can therefore be purified by\ndistillation.",
  "Many of the physical properties of zinc are much influenced by the\ntemperature and previous treatment of the metal. When cast into ingots\nfrom the liquid state it becomes at ordinary temperatures quite hard,\nbrittle, and highly crystalline. At 150° it is malleable and can be\nrolled into thin sheets; at higher temperatures it again becomes very\nbrittle. When once rolled into sheets it retains its softness and\nmalleability at ordinary temperatures. When melted and poured into water\nit forms thin brittle flakes, and in this condition is called granulated\nor mossy zinc.",
  "~Chemical properties.~ Zinc is tarnished superficially by moist air, but\nbeyond this is not affected by it. It does not decompose even boiling\nwater. When the metal is quite pure, sulphuric and hydrochloric acids\nhave scarcely any action upon it; when, however, it contains small\namounts of other metals such as magnesium or arsenic, or when it is\nmerely in contact with metallic platinum, brisk action takes place and\nhydrogen is evolved. For this reason, when pure zinc is used in the\npreparation of hydrogen a few drops of platinum chloride are often added\nto the solution to assist the chemical action. Nitric acid dissolves the\nmetal readily, with the formation of zinc nitrate and various reduction\nproducts of nitric acid. The strong alkalis act upon zinc and liberate\nhydrogen:",
  "Zn + 2KOH = Zn(OK)_{2} + 2H.",
  "The product of this reaction, potassium zincate, is a salt of zinc\nhydroxide, which is thus seen to have acid properties, though it usually\nacts as a base.",
  "~Uses of zinc.~ The metal has many familiar uses. Rolled into sheets, it\nis used as a lining for vessels which are to contain water. As a thin\nfilm upon the surface of iron (galvanized iron) it protects the iron\nfrom rust. Iron is usually galvanized by dipping it into a bath of\nmelted zinc, but electrical methods are also employed. Zinc plates are\nused in many forms of electrical batteries. In the laboratory zinc is\nused in the preparation of hydrogen, and in the form of zinc dust as a\nreducing agent.",
  "One of the largest uses of zinc is in the manufacture of alloys. Brass,\nan alloy of zinc and copper, is the most important of these; German\nsilver, consisting of copper, zinc, and nickel, has many uses; various\nbronzes, coin metals, and bearing metals also contain zinc. Its ability\nto alloy with silver finds application in the separation of silver from\nlead (see silver).",
  "~Compounds of zinc.~ In general, the compounds of zinc are similar in\nformula and appearance to those of magnesium, but in other properties\nthey often differ markedly. A number of them have value in commercial\nways.",
  "~Zinc oxide~ (_zinc white_) (ZnO). Zinc oxide occurs in impure form in\nnature, being colored red by manganese and iron compounds. It can be\nprepared just like magnesium oxide, but is more often made by burning\nthe metal.",
  "Zinc oxide is a pure white powder which becomes yellow on heating and\nregains its white color when cold. It is much used as a white pigment in\npaints, under the name of zinc white, and has the advantage over white\nlead in that it is not changed in color by sulphur compounds, while lead\nturns black. It is also used in the manufacture of rubber goods.",
  "~Commercial preparation of zinc oxide.~ Commercially it is often\n     made from franklinite in the following way. The franklinite is\n     mixed with coal and heated to a high temperature in a furnace,\n     by which process the zinc is set free and converted into vapor.\n     As the vapor leaves the furnace through a conduit it meets a\n     current of air and takes fire in it, forming zinc oxide. The\n     oxide passes on and is filtered from the air through canvas\n     bags, which allow the air to pass but retain the oxide. It is\n     thus made by burning the metal, though the metal is not\n     actually isolated in the process.",
  "~Soluble salts.~ The soluble salts of zinc can be made by dissolving the\nmetal or the oxide in the appropriate acid. They are all somewhat\npoisonous. The sulphate and chloride are the most familiar.",
  "~Zinc sulphate~ (_white vitriol_) (ZnSO_{4}·7H_{2}O). This salt is readily\ncrystallized from strong solutions in transparent colorless crystals. It\nis prepared commercially by careful roasting of the sulphide:",
  "ZnS + 4O = ZnSO_{4}.",
  "~Zinc chloride~ (ZnCl_{2}·H_{2}O). When a solution of zinc chloride is\nslowly evaporated a salt of the composition ZnCl_{2}·H_{2}O crystallizes\nout. If the water is completely expelled by heat and the residue\ndistilled, the anhydrous chloride is obtained and may be cast into\nsticks or broken into lumps. In this distillation, just as in heating\nmagnesium chloride, some of the chloride is decomposed:",
  "ZnCl_{2}·H_{2}O = ZnO + 2HCl.",
  "The anhydrous chloride has a great affinity for water, and is used as a\ndehydrating agent. It is also a germicide, and wood which is to be\nexposed to conditions which favor decay, as, for example, railroad ties,\nis often soaked in solutions of this salt.",
  "~Insoluble compounds.~ The insoluble compounds of zinc can be prepared by\nprecipitation. The most important are the sulphide, carbonate, and\nhydroxide.",
  "~Zinc sulphide~ (ZnS). This substance occurs as the mineral sphalerite,\nand is one of the most valued ores of zinc. Very large deposits occur in\nsouthwestern Missouri. The natural mineral is found in large crystals or\nmasses, resembling resin in color and luster. When prepared by\nprecipitation the sulphide is white.",
  "CADMIUM",
  "~The element.~ This element occurs in small quantities in some zinc ores.\nIn the course of the metallurgy of zinc the cadmium compounds undergo\nchemical changes quite similar to those of the zinc compounds, and the\ncadmium distills along with the zinc. Being more volatile, it comes over\nwith the first of the zinc and is prepared from the first portions of\nthe distillate by special methods of purification. The element very\nclosely resembles zinc in most respects. Some of its alloys are\ncharacterized by having low melting points.",
  "~Compounds of cadmium.~ Among the compounds of cadmium may be mentioned\nthe chloride (CdCl_{2}·2H_{2}O), the sulphate (3CdSO_{4}·8H_{2}O), and\nthe nitrate (Cd(NO_{3})_{2}·4H_{2}O). These are white solids soluble in\nwater. The sulphide (CdS) is a bright yellow substance which is\ninsoluble in water and in dilute acids. It is valuable as a pigment in\nfine paints.",
  "EXERCISES",
  "1. What properties have the metals of the magnesium family in common\nwith the alkali metals; with the alkaline-earth metals?",
  "2. Compare the action of the metals of the magnesium group on water with\nthat of the other metals studied.",

  "CHAPTER XXVI",
  "THE ALUMINIUM FAMILY",
  "~The family.~ The element aluminium is the most abundant member of the\ngroup of elements known as the aluminium family; indeed, the other\nmembers of the family--gallium, indium, and thallium--are of such rare\noccurrence that they need not be separately described. The elements of\nthe family are ordinarily trivalent, so that the formulas for their\ncompounds differ from those of the elements so far studied. Their\nhydroxides are practically insoluble in water and are very weak bases;\nindeed, the bases are so weak that their salts are often hydrolyzed into\nfree base and free acid in solution. The salts formed from these bases\nusually contain water of crystallization, which cannot be driven off\nwithout decomposing them more or less.",
  "The trivalent metals, which in addition to aluminium include also iron\nand chromium, are sometimes called the _earth metals_. The name refers\nto the earthy appearance of the oxides of these metals, and to the fact\nthat many earths, soils, and rocks are composed in part of these\nsubstances.",
  "ALUMINIUM",
  "~Occurrence.~ Aluminium never occurs in the free state in nature, owing to\nits great affinity for oxygen. In combined form, as oxides, silicates,\nand a few other salts, it is both abundant and widely distributed, being\nan essential constituent of all soils and of most rocks excepting\nlimestone and sandstone. Cryolite (Na_{3}AlF_{6}), found in Greenland,\nand bauxite, which is an aluminium hydroxide usually mixed with some\niron hydroxide, are important minerals. It is estimated that aluminium\ncomposes about 8% of the earth's crust. In the industries the metal is\ncalled aluminum, but its chemical name is aluminium.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 82]",
  "~Preparation.~ Aluminium was first prepared by Wöhler, in 1827, by heating\nanhydrous aluminium chloride with potassium:",
  "AlCl_{3} + 3K = 3KCl + Al.",
  "This method was tried after it was found impossible to reduce the oxide\nof aluminium with carbon. The metal possessed such interesting\nproperties and promised to be so useful that many efforts were made to\ndevise a cheap way of preparing it. The method which has proved most\nsuccessful consists in the electrolysis of the oxide dissolved in melted\ncryolite.",
  "~Metallurgy.~ An iron box A (Fig. 82) about eight feet long and\n     six feet wide is connected with a powerful generator in such a\n     way as to serve as the cathode upon which the aluminium is\n     deposited. Three or four rows of carbon rods B dip into the\n     box and serve as the anodes. The box is partially filled with\n     cryolite and the current is turned on, generating enough heat\n     to melt the cryolite. Aluminium oxide is then added, and under\n     the influence of the electric current it decomposes into\n     aluminium and oxygen. The temperature is maintained above the\n     melting point of aluminium, and the liquid metal, being heavier\n     than cryolite, sinks to the bottom of the vessel, from which it\n     is tapped off from time to time through the tap hole C. The\n     oxygen in part escapes as gas, and in part combines with the\n     carbon of the anode, the combustion being very brilliant. The\n     process is carried on at Niagara Falls.",
  "The largest expense in the process, apart from the cost of\n     electrical energy, is the preparation of aluminium oxide free\n     from other oxides, for most of the oxide found in nature is too\n     impure to serve without refining. Bauxite is the principal ore\n     used as a source of the aluminium because it is converted into\n     pure oxide without great difficulty. Since common clay is a\n     silicate of aluminium and is everywhere abundant, it might be\n     expected that this would be utilized in the preparation of\n     aluminium. It is, however, very difficult to extract the\n     aluminium from a silicate, and no practical method has been\n     found which will accomplish this.",
  "~Physical properties.~ Aluminium is a tin-white metal which melts at 640°\nand is very light, having a density of 2.68. It is stiff and strong, and\nwith frequent annealing can be rolled into thin foil. It is a good\nconductor of heat and electricity, though not so good as copper for a\ngiven cross section of wire.",
  "~Chemical properties.~ Aluminium is not perceptibly acted on by boiling\nwater, and moist air merely dims its luster. Further action is prevented\nin each case by the formation of an extremely thin film of oxide upon\nthe surface of the metal. It combines directly with chlorine, and when\nheated in oxygen burns with great energy and the liberation of much\nheat. It is therefore a good reducing agent. Hydrochloric acid acts upon\nit, forming aluminium chloride: nitric acid and dilute sulphuric acid\nhave almost no action on it, but hot, concentrated sulphuric acid acts\nupon it in the same way as upon copper:",
  "2Al + 6H_{2}SO_{4} = Al_{2}(SO_{4})_{3} + 6H_{2}O + 3SO_{2}.",
  "Alkalis readily attack the metal, liberating hydrogen, as in the case of\nzinc:",
  "Al + 3KOH = Al(OK)_{3} + 3H.",
  "Salt solutions, such as sea water, corrode the metal rapidly. It alloys\nreadily with other metals.",
  "~Uses of aluminium.~ These properties suggest many uses for the metal. Its\nlightness, strength, and permanence make it well adapted for many\nconstruction purposes. These same properties have led to its extensive\nuse in the manufacture of cooking utensils. The fact that it is easily\ncorroded by salt solutions is, however, a disadvantage. Owing to its\nsmall resistance to electrical currents, it is replacing copper to some\nextent in electrical construction, especially for trolley and power\nwires. Some of its alloys have very valuable properties, and a\nconsiderable part of the aluminium manufactured is used for this\npurpose. Aluminium bronze, consisting of about 90% copper and 10%\naluminium, has a pure golden color, is strong and malleable, is easily\ncast, and is permanent in the air. Considerable amounts of aluminium\nsteel are also made.",
  "~Goldschmidt reduction process.~ Aluminium is frequently employed as a\npowerful reducing agent, many metallic oxides which resist reduction by\ncarbon being readily reduced by it. The aluminium in the form of a fine\npowder is mixed with the metallic oxide, together with some substance\nsuch as fluorspar to act as a flux. The mixture is ignited, and the\naluminium unites with the oxygen of the metallic oxide, liberating the\nmetal. This collects in a fused condition under the flux.",
  "An enormous quantity of heat is liberated in this reaction, and a\ntemperature as high as 3500° can be reached. The heat of the reaction is\nturned to practical account in welding car rails, steel castings, and in\nsimilar operations where an intense local heat is required. A mixture of\naluminium with various metallic oxides, ready prepared for such\npurposes, is sold under the name of _thermite_.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 83]",
  "~Preparation of chromium by the Goldschmidt method.~ A mixture of\n     chromium oxide and aluminium powder is placed in a Hessian\n     crucible (A, Fig. 83), and on top of it is placed a small\n     heap B of a mixture of sodium peroxide and aluminium, into\n     which is stuck a piece of magnesium ribbon C. Powdered\n     fluorspar D is placed around the sodium peroxide, after which\n     the crucible is set on a pan of sand and the magnesium ribbon\n     ignited. When the flame reaches the sodium peroxide mixture\n     combustion of the aluminium begins with almost explosive\n     violence, so that great care must be taken in the experiment.\n     The heat of this combustion starts the reaction in the chromium\n     oxide mixture, and the oxide is reduced to metallic chromium.\n     When the crucible has cooled a button of chromium will be found\n     in the bottom.",
  "~Aluminium oxide~ (Al_{2}O_{3}). This substance occurs in several forms in\nnature. The relatively pure crystals are called corundum, while emery is\na variety colored dark gray or black, usually with iron compounds. In\ntransparent crystals, tinted different colors by traces of impurities,\nit forms such precious stones as the sapphire, oriental ruby, topaz, and\namethyst. All these varieties are very hard, falling little short of\nthe diamond in this respect. Chemically pure aluminium oxide can be made\nby igniting the hydroxide, when it forms an amorphous white powder:",
  "2Al(OH)_{3} = Al_{2}O_{3} + 3H_{2}O.",
  "The natural varieties, corundum and emery, are used for cutting and\ngrinding purposes; the purest forms, together with the artificially\nprepared oxide, are largely used in the preparation of aluminium.",
  "~Aluminium hydroxide~ (Al(OH)_{3}). The hydroxide occurs in nature as the\nmineral hydrargyllite, and in a partially dehydrated form called\nbauxite. It can be prepared by adding ammonium hydroxide to any soluble\naluminium salt, forming a semi-transparent precipitate which is\ninsoluble in water but very hard to filter. It dissolves in most acids\nto form soluble salts, and in the strong bases to form aluminates, as\nindicated in the equations",
  "Al(OH)_{3} + 3HCl = AlCl_{3} + 3H_{2}O,\n    Al(OH)_{3} + 3NaOH = Al(ONa)_{3} + 3H_{2}O.",
  "It may act, therefore, either as a weak base or as a weak acid, its\naction depending upon the character of the substances with which it is\nin contact. When heated gently the hydroxide loses part of its hydrogen\nand oxygen according to the equation",
  "Al(OH)_{3} = AlO·OH + H_{2}O.",
  "This substance, the formula of which is frequently written HAlO_{2}, is\na more pronounced acid than is the hydroxide, and its salts are\nfrequently formed when aluminium compounds are fused with alkalis. The\nmagnesium salt Mg(AlO_{2})_{2} is called spinel, and many other of its\nsalts, called aluminates, are found in nature.",
  "When heated strongly the hydroxide is changed into oxide, which will not\nagain take up water on being moistened.",
  "~Mordants and dyeing.~ Aluminium hydroxide has the peculiar\n     property of combining with many soluble coloring materials and\n     forming insoluble products with them. On this account it is\n     often used as a filter to remove objectionable colors from\n     water. This property also leads to its wide use in the dye\n     industry. Many dyes will not adhere to natural fibers such as\n     cotton and wool, that is, will not \"dye fast.\" If, however, the\n     cloth to be dyed is soaked in a solution of aluminium compounds\n     and then treated with ammonia, the aluminium salts which have\n     soaked into the fiber will be converted into the hydroxide,\n     which, being insoluble, remains in the body of it. If the fiber\n     is now dipped into a solution of the dye, the aluminium\n     hydroxide combines with the color material and fastens, or\n     \"fixes,\" it upon the fiber. A substance which serves this\n     purpose is called a _mordant_, and aluminium salts,\n     particularly the acetate, are used in this way.",
  "~Aluminium chloride~ (AlCl_{3}·6 H_{2}O). This substance is prepared by\ndissolving the hydroxide in hydrochloric acid and evaporating to\ncrystallization. When heated it is converted into the oxide, resembling\nmagnesium in this respect:",
  "2(AlCl_{3}·6 H_{2}O) = Al_{2}O_{3} + 6HCl + 9H_{2}O.",
  "The anhydrous chloride, which has some important uses, is made by\nheating aluminium turnings in a current of chlorine.",
  "~Alums.~ Aluminium sulphate can be prepared by the action of sulphuric\nacid upon aluminium hydroxide. It has the property of combining with the\nsulphates of the alkali metals to form compounds called _alums_. Thus,\nwith potassium sulphate the reaction is expressed by the equation",
  "K_{2}SO_{4} + Al_{2}(SO_{4})_{3} + 24H_{2}O\n       = 2(KAl(SO_{4})_{2}·12H_{2}O).",
  "Under similar conditions ammonium sulphate yields ammonium alum:",
  "(NH_{4})_{2}SO_{4} + Al_{2}(SO_{4})_{3} + 24H_{2}O\n        = 2(NH_{4}Al(SO_{4})_{2}·12H_{2}O).",
  "Other trivalent sulphates besides aluminium sulphate can form similar\ncompounds with the alkali sulphates, and these compounds are also called\nalums, though they contain no aluminium. They all crystallize in\noctahedra and contain twelve molecules of water of crystallization. The\nalums most frequently prepared are the following:",
  "Potassium alum               KAl(SO_{4})_{2}·12H_{2}O.\n    Ammonium alum                NH_{4}Al(SO_{4})_{2}·12H_{2}O.\n    Ammonium iron alum           NH_{4}Fe(SO_{4})_{2}·12H_{2}O.\n    Potassium chrome alum        KCr(SO_{4})_{2}·12H_{2}O.",
  "An alum may therefore be regarded as a compound derived from two\nmolecules of sulphuric acid, in which one hydrogen atom has been\ndisplaced by the univalent alkali atom, and the other three hydrogen\natoms by an atom of one of the trivalent metals, such as aluminium,\niron, or chromium.",
  "Very large, well-formed crystals of an alum can be prepared by\n     suspending a small crystal by a thread in a saturated solution\n     of the alum, as shown in Fig. 84. The small crystal slowly\n     grows and assumes a very perfect form.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 84]",
  "~Other salts of aluminium.~ While aluminium hydroxide forms fairly stable\nsalts with strong acids, it is such a weak base that its salts with weak\nacids are readily hydrolyzed. Thus, when an aluminium salt and a soluble\ncarbonate are brought together in solution we should expect to have\naluminium carbonate precipitated according to the equation",
  "3Na_{2}CO_{3} + 2AlCl_{3} = Al_{2}(CO_{3})_{3} + 6NaCl.",
  "But if it is formed at all, it instantly begins to hydrolyze, the\nproducts of the hydrolysis being aluminium hydroxide and carbonic acid,",
  "Al_{2}(CO_{3})_{3} + 6H_{2}O = 2Al(OH)_{3} + 3H_{2}CO_{3}.",
  "Similarly a soluble sulphide, instead of precipitating aluminium\nsulphide (Al_{2}S_{3}), precipitates aluminium hydroxide; for hydrogen\nsulphide is such a weak acid that the aluminium sulphide at first formed\nhydrolyzes at once, forming aluminium hydroxide and hydrogen sulphide:",
  "3Na_{2}S + 2AlCl_{3} + 6H_{2}O = 2Al(OH)_{3} + 6NaCl + 3H_{2}S.",
  "~Alum baking powders.~ It is because of the hydrolysis of aluminium\ncarbonate that alum is used as a constituent of some baking powders. The\nalum baking powders consist of a mixture of alum and sodium hydrogen\ncarbonate. When water is added the two compounds react together, forming\naluminium carbonate, which hydrolyzes into aluminium hydroxide and\ncarbonic acid. The carbon dioxide from the latter escapes through the\ndough and in so doing raises it into a porous condition, which is the\nend sought in the use of a baking powder.",
  "~Aluminium silicates.~ One of the most common constituents of rocks is\nfeldspar (KAlSi_{3}O_{8}), a mixed salt of potassium and aluminium with\nthe polysilicic acid (H_{4}Si_{3}O_{8}). Under the influence of\nmoisture, carbon dioxide, and changes of temperature this substance is\nconstantly being broken down into soluble potassium compounds and\nhydrated aluminium silicate. This compound has the formula\nAl_{2}Si_{2}O_{7}·2H_{2}O. In relatively pure condition it is called\nkaolin; in the impure state, mixed with sand and other substances, it\nforms common clay. Mica is another very abundant mineral, having varying\ncomposition, but being essentially of the formula KAlSiO_{4}.\nSerpentine, talc, asbestos, and meerschaum are important complex\nsilicates of aluminium and magnesium, and granite is a mechanical\nmixture of quartz, feldspar, and mica.",
  "~Ceramic industries.~ Many articles of greatest practical\n     importance, ranging from the roughest brick and tile to the\n     finest porcelain and chinaware, are made from some form of\n     kaolin, or clay. No very precise classification of such ware\n     can be made, as the products vary greatly in properties,\n     depending upon the materials used and the treatment during\n     manufacture.",
  "Porcelain is made from the purest kaolin, to which must be\n     added some less pure, plastic kaolin, since the pure substance\n     is not sufficiently plastic. There is also added some more\n     fusible substance, such as feldspar, gypsum, or lime, together\n     with some pure quartz. The constituents must be ground very\n     fine, and when thoroughly mixed and moistened must make a\n     plastic mass which can be molded into any desired form. The\n     article molded from such materials is then burned. In this\n     process the article is slowly heated to a point at which it\n     begins to soften and almost fuse, and then it is allowed to\n     cool slowly. At this stage, a very thin vessel will be\n     translucent and have an almost glassy fracture; if, however, it\n     is somewhat thicker, or has not been heated quite so high, it\n     will still be porous, and partly on this account and partly to\n     improve its appearance it is usually glazed.",
  "Glazing is accomplished by spreading upon the object a thin\n     layer of a more fusible mixture of the same materials as\n     compose the body of the object itself, and again heating until\n     the glaze melts to a transparent glassy coating upon the\n     surface of the vessel. In some cases fusible mixtures of quite\n     different composition from that used in fashioning the vessel\n     may be used as a glaze. Oxides of lead, zinc, and barium are\n     often used in this way.",
  "When less carefully selected materials are used, or quite thick\n     vessels are made, various grades of stoneware are produced. The\n     inferior grades are glazed by throwing a quantity of common\n     salt into the kiln towards the end of the first firing. In the\n     form of vapor the salt attacks the surface of the baked ware\n     and forms an easily fusible sodium silicate upon it, which\n     constitutes a glaze.",
  "Vitrified bricks, made from clay or ground shale, are burned\n     until the materials begin to fuse superficially, forming their\n     own glaze. Other forms of brick and tile are not glazed at all,\n     but are left porous. The red color of ordinary brick and\n     earthenware is due to an oxide of iron formed in the burning\n     process.",
  "The decorations upon china are sometimes painted upon the baked\n     ware and then glazed over, and sometimes painted upon the glaze\n     and burned in by a third firing. Care must be taken to use such\n     pigments as are not affected by a high heat and do not react\n     chemically with the constituents of the baked ware or the\n     glaze.",

  "~The family.~ The elements iron, cobalt, and nickel form a group in the\neighth column of the periodic table. The atomic weights of the three are\nvery close together, and there is not the same gradual gradation in the\nproperties of the three elements that is noticed in the families in\nwhich the atomic weights differ considerably in magnitude. The elements\nare very similar in properties, the similarity being so great in the\ncase of nickel and cobalt that it is difficult to separate them by\nchemical analysis.",
  "The elements occur in nature chiefly as oxides and sulphides, though\nthey have been found in very small quantities in the native state,\nusually in meteorites. Their sulphides, carbonates, and phosphates are\ninsoluble in water, the other common salts being soluble. Their salts\nare usually highly colored, those of iron being yellow or light green as\na rule, those of nickel darker green, while cobalt salts are usually\nrose colored. The metals are obtained by reducing the oxides with\ncarbon.",
  "IRON",
  "~Occurrence.~ The element iron has long been known, since its ores are\nvery abundant and it is not difficult to prepare the metal from them in\nfairly pure condition. It occurs in nature in many forms of\ncombination,--in large deposits as oxides, sulphides, and carbonates,\nand in smaller quantities in a great variety of minerals. Indeed, very\nfew rocks or soils are free from small amounts of iron, and it is\nassimilated by plants and animals playing an important part in life\nprocesses.",
  "~Metallurgy.~ It will be convenient to treat of the metallurgy of iron\nunder two heads,--Materials Used and Process.",
  "~Materials used.~ Four distinct materials are used in the metallurgy of\niron:",
  "1. _Iron ore._ The ores most frequently used in the metallurgy\n     of iron are the following:",
  "Hematite      Fe_{2}O_{3}.\n         Magnetite     Fe_{3}O_{4}.\n         Siderite      FeCO_{3}.\n         Limonite      2Fe_{2}O_{2}·3H_{2}O.",
  "These ores always contain impurities, such as silica,\n     sulphides, and earthy materials. All ores, with the exception\n     of the oxides, are first roasted to expel any water and carbon\n     dioxide present and to convert any sulphide into oxide.",
  "2. _Carbon._ Carbon in some form is necessary both as a fuel\n     and as a reducing agent. In former times wood charcoal was used\n     to supply the carbon, but now anthracite coal or coke is almost\n     universally used.",
  "3. _Hot air._ To maintain the high temperature required for the\n     reduction of iron a very active combustion of fuel is\n     necessary. This is secured by forcing a strong blast of hot air\n     into the lower part of the furnace during the reduction\n     process.",
  "4. _Flux._ (a) _Purpose of the flux._ All the materials which\n     enter the furnace must leave it again either in the form of\n     gases or as liquids. The iron is drawn off as the liquid metal\n     after its reduction. To secure the removal of the earthy matter\n     charged into the furnace along with the ore, materials are\n     added to the charge which will, at the high temperature of the\n     furnace, combine with the impurities in the ore, forming a\n     liquid. The material added for this purpose is called the\n     _flux_; the liquid produced from the flux and the ore is called\n     _slag_.",
  "(b) _Function of the slag._ While the main purpose of adding\n     flux to the charge is to remove from the furnace in the form of\n     liquid slag the impurities originally present in the ore, the\n     slag thus produced serves several other functions. It keeps the\n     contents of the furnace in a state of fusion, thus preventing\n     clogging, and makes it possible for the small globules of iron\n     to run together with greater ease into one large liquid mass.",
  "(c) _Character of the slag._ The slag is really a kind of\n     readily fusible glass, being essentially a calcium-aluminium\n     silicate. The ore usually contains silica and some aluminium\n     compounds, so that limestone (which also contains some silica\n     and aluminium) is added to furnish the calcium required for the\n     slag. If the ore and the limestone do not contain a sufficient\n     amount of silica and aluminium for the formation of the slag,\n     these ingredients are added in the form of sand and feldspar.\n     In the formation of slag from these materials the ore is freed\n     from the silica and aluminium which it contained.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 85]",
  "~Process.~ The reduction of iron is carried out in large towers called\nblast furnaces. The blast furnace (Fig. 85) is usually about 80 ft. high\nand 20 ft. in internal diameter at its widest part, narrowing somewhat\nboth toward the top and toward the bottom. The walls are built of steel\nand lined with fire-brick. The base is provided with a number of pipes\nT, called tuyers, through which hot air can be forced into the\nfurnace. The tuyers are supplied from a large pipe S, which circles\nthe furnace as a girdle. The base has also an opening M, through which\nthe liquid metal can be drawn off from time to time, and a second\nopening P, somewhat above the first, through which the excess of slag\noverflows. The top is closed by a movable trap C and C, called the\ncone, and through this the materials to be used are introduced. The\ngases produced by the combustion of the fuel and the reduction of the\nore, together with the nitrogen of the air forced in through the tuyers,\nescape through pipes D, called downcomer pipes, which leave the\nfurnace near the top. These gases are very hot and contain combustible\nsubstances, principally carbon monoxide; they are therefore utilized as\nfuel for the engines and also to heat the blast admitted through the\ntuyers. The lower part of the furnace is often furnished with a water\njacket. This consists of a series of pipes W built into the walls,\nthrough which water can be circulated to reduce their temperature.",
  "Charges consisting of coke (or anthracite coal), ore, and flux in proper\nproportions are introduced into the furnace at intervals through the\ntrap top. The coke burns fiercely in the hot-air blast, giving an\nintense heat and forming carbon monoxide. The ore, working down in the\nfurnace as the coke burns, becomes very hot, and by the combined\nreducing action of the carbon and carbon monoxide is finally reduced to\nmetal and collects as a liquid in the bottom of the furnace, the slag\nfloating on the molten iron. After a considerable amount of the iron has\ncollected the slag is drawn off through the opening P. The molten iron\nis then drawn off into large ladles and taken to the converters for the\nmanufacture of steel, or it is run out into sand molds, forming the bars\nor ingots called \"pigs.\" The process is a continuous one, and when once\nstarted it is kept in operation for months or even years without\ninterruption.",
  "It seems probable that the first product of combustion of the\n     carbon, at the point where the tuyers enter the furnace, is\n     carbon dioxide. This is at once reduced to carbon monoxide by\n     the intensely heated carbon present, so that no carbon dioxide\n     can be found at that point. For practical purposes, therefore,\n     we may consider that carbon monoxide is the first product of\n     combustion.",
  "~Varieties of iron.~ The iron of commerce is never pure, but contains\nvarying amounts of other elements, such as carbon, silicon, phosphorus,\nsulphur, and manganese. These elements may either be alloyed with the\niron or may be combined with it in the form of definite chemical\ncompounds. In some instances, as in the case of graphite, the mixture\nmay be merely mechanical.",
  "The properties of iron are very much modified by the presence of these\nelements and by the form of the combination between them and the iron;\nthe way in which the metal is treated during its preparation has also a\nmarked influence on its properties. Owing to these facts many kinds of\niron are recognized in commerce, the chief varieties being cast iron,\nwrought iron, and steel.",
  "~Cast iron.~ The product of the blast furnace, prepared as just described,\nis called cast iron. It varies considerably in composition, usually\ncontaining from 90 to 95% iron, the remainder being largely carbon and\nsilicon with smaller amounts of phosphorus and sulphur. When the melted\nmetal from the blast furnace is allowed to cool rapidly most of the\ncarbon remains in chemical combination with the iron, and the product is\ncalled white cast iron. If the cooling goes on slowly, the carbon\npartially separates as flakes of graphite which remain scattered through\nthe metal. This product is softer and darker in color and is called gray\ncast iron.",
  "~Properties of cast iron.~ Cast iron is hard, brittle, and rather easily\nmelted (melting point about 1100°). It cannot be welded or forged into\nshape, but is easily cast in sand molds. It is strong and rigid but not\nelastic. It is used for making castings and in the manufacture of other\nkinds of iron. Cast iron, which contains the metal manganese up to the\nextent of 20%, together with about 3% carbon, is called spiegel iron;\nwhen more than this amount of manganese is present the product is called\nferromanganese. The ferromanganese may contain as much as 80% manganese.\nThese varieties of cast iron are much used in the manufacture of steel.",
  "~Wrought iron.~ Wrought iron is made by burning out from cast iron most of\nthe carbon, silicon, phosphorus, and sulphur which it contains. The\nprocess is called _puddling_, and is carried out in a furnace\nconstructed as represented in Fig. 86. The floor of the furnace F is\nsomewhat concave and is made of iron covered with a layer of iron oxide.\nA long flame produced by burning fuel upon the grate G is directed\ndownward upon the materials placed upon the floor, and the draught is\nmaintained by the stack S. A is the ash box and T a trap to catch\nthe solid particles carried into the stack by the draught. Upon the\nfloor of the furnace is placed the charge of cast iron, together with a\nsmall amount of material to make a slag. The iron is soon melted by the\nflame directed upon it, and the sulphur, phosphorus, and silicon are\noxidized by the iron oxide, forming oxides which are anhydrides of\nacids. These combine with the flux, which is basic in character, or with\nthe iron oxide, to form a slag. The carbon is also oxidized and escapes\nas carbon dioxide. As the iron is freed from other elements it becomes\npasty, owing to the higher melting point of the purer iron, and in this\ncondition forms small lumps which are raked together into a larger one.\nThe large lump is then removed from the furnace and rolled or hammered\ninto bars, the slag; being squeezed out in this process. The product has\na stranded or fibrous structure. _The product of a puddling furnace is\ncalled wrought iron._",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 86]",
  "~Properties of wrought iron.~ Wrought iron is nearly pure iron, usually\ncontaining about 0.3% of other substances, chiefly carbon. It is tough,\nmalleable, and fibrous in structure. It is easily bent and is not\nelastic, so it will not sustain pressure as well as cast iron. It can be\ndrawn out into wire of great tensile strength, and can also be rolled\ninto thin sheets (sheet iron). It melts at a high temperature (about\n1600°) and is therefore forged into shape rather than cast. If melted,\nit would lose its fibrous structure and be changed into a low carbon\nsteel.",
  "~Steel.~ Steel, like wrought iron, is made by burning out from cast iron a\npart of the carbon, silicon, phosphorus, and sulphur which it contains;\nbut the process is carried out in a very different way, and usually,\nthough not always, more carbon is found in steel than in wrought iron. A\nnumber of processes are in use, but nearly all the steel of commerce is\nmade by one of the two following methods.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 87]",
  "1. _Bessemer process._ This process, invented about 1860, is by far the\nmost important. It is carried out in great egg-shaped crucibles called\nconverters (Fig. 87), each one of which will hold as much as 15 tons of\nsteel. The converter is built of steel and lined with silica. It is\nmounted on trunnions T, so that it can be tipped over on its side for\nfilling and emptying. One of the trunnions is hollow and a pipe P\nconnects it with an air chamber A, which forms a false bottom to the\nconverter. The true bottom is perforated, so that air can be forced in\nby an air blast admitted through the trunnion and the air chamber.",
  "White-hot, liquid cast iron from a blast furnace is run into the\nconverter through its open necklike top O, the converter being tipped\nover to receive it; the air blast is then turned on and the converter\nrotated to a nearly vertical position. The elements in the iron are\nrapidly oxidized, the silicon first and then the carbon. The heat\nliberated in the oxidation, largely due to the combustion of silicon,\nkeeps the iron in a molten condition. When the carbon is practically all\nburned out cast iron or spiegel iron, containing a known percentage of\ncarbon, is added and allowed to mix thoroughly with the fluid. The steel\nis then run into molds, and the ingots so formed are hammered or rolled\ninto rails or other forms. By this process any desired percentage of\ncarbon can be added to the steel. Low carbon steel, which does not\ndiffer much from wrought iron in composition, is now made in this way\nand is replacing the more expensive wrought iron for many purposes.",
  "~The basic lining process.~ When the cast iron contains\n     phosphorus and sulphur in appreciable quantities, the lining of\n     the converter is made of dolomite. The silicon and carbon burn,\n     followed by the phosphorus and sulphur, and the anhydrides of\n     acids so formed combine with the basic oxides of the lining,\n     forming a slag. This is known as the basic lining process.",
  "2. _Open-hearth process._ In this process a furnace very similar to a\npuddling furnace is used, but it is lined with silica or dolomite\ninstead of iron oxide. A charge consisting in part of old scrap iron of\nany kind and in part of cast iron is melted in the furnace by a gas\nflame. The silicon and carbon are slowly burned away, and when a test\nshows that the desired percentage of carbon is present the steel is run\nout of the furnace. _Steel may therefore be defined as the product of\nthe Bessemer or open-hearth processes._",
  "~Properties of steel.~ Bessemer and open-hearth steel usually contain only\na few tenths of a per cent of carbon, less than 0.1% silicon, and a very\nmuch smaller quantity of phosphorus and sulphur. Any considerable amount\nof the latter elements makes the steel brittle, the sulphur affecting it\nwhen hot, and the phosphorus when cold. This kind of steel is used for\nstructural purposes, for rails, and for nearly all large steel articles.\nIt is hard, malleable, ductile, and melts at a lower temperature than\nwrought iron. It can be forged into shape, rolled into sheets, or cast\nin molds.",
  "~Relation of the three varieties of iron.~ It will be seen that wrought\niron is usually very nearly pure iron, while steel contains an\nappreciable amount of alloy material, chiefly carbon, and cast iron\nstill more of the same substances. It is impossible, however, to assign\na given sample of iron to one of these three classes on the basis of its\nchemical composition alone. A low carbon steel, for example, may contain\nless carbon than a given sample of wrought iron. The real distinction\nbetween the three is the process by which they are made. The product of\nthe blast furnace is cast iron; that of the puddling furnace is wrought\niron; that of the Bessemer and open-hearth methods is steel.",
  "~Tool steel.~ Steel designed for use in the manufacture of edged tools and\nsimilar articles should be relatively free from silicon and phosphorus,\nbut should contain from 0.5 to 1.5% carbon. The percentage of carbon\nshould be regulated by the exact use to which the steel is to be put.\nSteel of this character is usually made in small lots from either\nBessemer or open-hearth steel in the following way.",
  "A charge of melted steel is placed in a large crucible and the\ncalculated quantity of pure carbon is added. The carbon dissolves in the\nsteel, and when the solution is complete the metal is poured out of the\ncrucible. This is sometimes called crucible steel.",
  "~Tempering of steel.~ Steel containing from 0.5 to 1.5% carbon is\ncharacterized by the property of \"taking temper.\" When the hot steel is\nsuddenly cooled by plunging it into water or oil it becomes very hard\nand brittle. On carefully reheating this hard form it gradually becomes\nless brittle and softer, so that by regulating the temperature to which\nsteel is reheated in tempering almost any condition of temper demanded\nfor a given purpose, such as for making springs or cutting tools, can be\nobtained.",
  "~Steel alloys.~ It has been found that small quantities of a number of\ndifferent elements when alloyed with steel very much improve its quality\nfor certain purposes, each element having a somewhat different effect.\nAmong the elements most used in this connection are manganese, silicon,\nchromium, nickel, tungsten, and molybdenum.",
  "The usual method for adding these elements to the steel is to first\nprepare a very rich alloy of iron with the element to be added, and then\nadd enough of this alloy to a large quantity of the steel to bring it to\nthe desired composition. A rich alloy of iron with manganese or silicon\ncan be prepared directly in a blast furnace, and is called\nferromanganese or ferrosilicon. Similar alloys of iron with the other\nelements mentioned are made in an electric furnace by reducing the mixed\noxides with carbon.",
  "~Pure iron.~ Perfectly pure iron is rarely prepared and is not adapted to\ncommercial uses. It can be made by reducing pure oxide of iron in a\ncurrent of hydrogen at a high temperature. Prepared in this way it\nforms a black powder; when melted it forms a tin-white metal which is\nless fusible and more malleable than wrought iron. It is easily acted\nupon by moist air.",
  "~Compounds of iron.~ Iron differs from the metals so far studied in that\nit is able to form two series of compounds in which the iron has two\ndifferent valences. In the one series the iron is divalent and forms\ncompounds which in formulas and many chemical properties are similar to\nthe corresponding zinc compounds. It can also act as a trivalent metal,\nand in this condition forms salts similar to those of aluminium. Those\ncompounds in which the iron is divalent are known as _ferrous_\ncompounds, while those in which it is trivalent are known as _ferric_.",
  "~Oxides of iron.~ Iron forms several oxides. Ferrous oxide (FeO) is not\nfound in nature, but can be prepared artificially in the form of a black\npowder which easily takes up oxygen, forming ferric oxide:",
  "2FeO + O = Fe_{2}O_{3}.",
  "Ferric oxide is the most abundant ore of iron and occurs in great\ndeposits, especially in the Lake Superior region. It is found in many\nmineral varieties which vary in density and color, the most abundant\nbeing hematite, which ranges in color from red to nearly black. When\nprepared by chemical processes it forms a red powder which is used as a\npaint pigment (Venetian red) and as a polishing powder (rouge).",
  "Magnetite has the formula Fe_{3}O_{4} and is a combination of FeO and\nFe_{2}O_{3}. It is a very valuable ore, but is less abundant than\nhematite. It is sometimes called magnetic oxide of iron, or lodestone,\nsince it is a natural magnet.",
  "~Ferrous salts.~ These salts are obtained by dissolving iron in the\nappropriate acid, or, when insoluble, by precipitation. They are usually\nlight green in color and crystallize well. In chemical reactions they\nare quite similar to the salts of magnesium and zinc, but differ from\nthem in one important respect, namely, that they are easily changed into\ncompounds in which the metal is trivalent. Thus ferrous chloride treated\nwith chlorine or aqua regia is changed into ferric chloride:",
  "FeCl_{2} + Cl = FeCl_{3}.",
  "Ferrous hydroxide exposed to moist air is rapidly changed into ferric\nhydroxide:",
  "2Fe(OH)_{2} + H_{2}O + O = 2Fe(OH)_{3}.",
  "~Ferrous sulphate~ _(copperas, green vitriol)_ (FeSO_{4}·7H_{2}O). Ferrous\nsulphate is the most familiar ferrous compound. It is prepared\ncommercially as a by-product in the steel-plate mills. Steel plates are\ncleaned by the action of dilute sulphuric acid upon them, and in the\nprocess some of the iron dissolves. The liquors are concentrated and the\ngreen vitriol separates from them.",
  "~Ferrous sulphide~ (FeS). Ferrous sulphide is sometimes found in nature as\na golden-yellow crystalline mineral. It is formed as a black precipitate\nwhen a soluble sulphide and an iron salt are brought together in\nsolution:",
  "FeSO_{4} + Na_{2}S = FeS + Na_{2}SO_{4}.",
  "It can also be made as a heavy dark-brown solid by fusing together the\nrequisite quantities of sulphur and iron. It is obtained as a by-product\nin the metallurgy of lead:",
  "PbS + Fe = FeS + Pb.",
  "It is used in the laboratory in the preparation of hydrosulphuric acid:",
  "FeS + 2HCl = FeCl_{2} + H_{2}S.",
  "~Iron disulphide~ _(pyrites)_ (FeS_{2}). This substance bears the same\nrelation to ferrous sulphide that hydrogen dioxide does to water. It\noccurs abundantly in nature in the form of brass-yellow cubical crystals\nand in compact masses. Sometimes the name \"fool's gold\" is applied to it\nfrom its superficial resemblance to the precious metal. It is used in\nvery large quantities as a source of sulphur dioxide in the manufacture\nof sulphuric acid, since it burns readily in the air, forming ferric\noxide and sulphur dioxide:",
  "2FeS_{2} + 11O = Fe_{2}O_{3} + 4SO_{2}.",
  "~Ferrous carbonate~ (FeCO_{3}). This compound occurs in nature as\nsiderite, and is a valuable ore. It will dissolve to some extent in\nwater containing carbon dioxide, just as will calcium carbonate, and\nwaters containing it are called chalybeate waters. These chalybeate\nwaters are supposed to possess certain medicinal virtues and form an\nimportant class of mineral waters.",
  "~Ferric salts.~ Ferric salts are usually obtained by treating an acidified\nsolution of a ferrous salt with an oxidizing agent:",
  "2FeCl_{2} + 2HCl + O = 2FeCl_{3} + H_{2}O,",
  "2FeSO_{4} + H_{2}SO_{4} + O = Fe_{2}(SO_{4})_{3} + H_{2}O.",
  "They are usually yellow or violet in color, are quite soluble, and as a\nrule do not crystallize well. Heated with water in the absence of free\nacid, they hydrolyze even more readily than the salts of aluminium. The\nmost familiar ferric salts are the chloride and the sulphate.",
  "~Ferric chloride~ (FeCl_{3}). This salt can be obtained most conveniently\nby dissolving iron in hydrochloric acid and then passing chlorine into\nthe solution:",
  "Fe + 2HCl = FeCl_{2} + 2H,",
  "FeCl_{2} + Cl = FeCl_{3}.",
  "When the pure salt is heated with water it is partly hydrolyzed:",
  "FeCl_{3} + 3 H_{2}O <--> Fe(OH)_{3} + 3HCl.",
  "This is a reversible reaction, however, and hydrolysis can therefore be\nprevented by first adding a considerable amount of the soluble product\nof the reaction, namely, hydrochloric acid.",
  "~Ferric sulphate~ (Fe_{2}(SO_{4})_{3}). This compound can be made by\ntreating an acid solution of green vitriol with an oxidizing agent. It\nis difficult to crystallize and hard to obtain in pure condition. When\nan alkali sulphate in proper quantity is added to ferric sulphate in\nsolution an iron alum is formed, and is easily obtained in\nlarge crystals. The best known iron alums have the formulas\nKFe(SO_{4})_{2}·12H_{2}O and NH_{4}Fe(SO_{4})_{2}·12H_{2}O. They are\ncommonly used when a pure ferric salt is required.",
  "~Ferric hydroxide~ (Fe(OH)_{3}). When solutions of ferric salts are\ntreated with ammonium hydroxide, ferric hydroxide is formed as a\nrusty-red precipitate, insoluble in water.",
  "~Iron cyanides.~ A large number of complex cyanides containing iron are\nknown, the most important being potassium ferrocyanide, or yellow\nprussiate of potash (K_{4}FeC_{6}N_{6}), and potassium ferricyanide, or\nred prussiate of potash (K_{3}FeC_{6}N_{6}). These compounds are the\npotassium salts of the complex acids of the formulas H_{4}FeC_{6}N_{6}\nand H_{3}FeC_{6}N_{6}.",
  "~Oxidation of ferrous salts.~ It has just been seen that when a ferrous\nsalt is treated with an oxidizing agent in the presence of a free acid a\nferric salt is formed:",
  "2FeSO_{4} + H_{2}SO_{4} + O = Fe_{2}(SO_{4})_{3} + H_{2}O.",
  "In this reaction oxygen is used up, and the valence of the iron is\nchanged from 2 to 3. The same equation may be written",
  "2Fe^{++}, 2SO_{4}^{--} + 2H^{+}, SO_{4}^{--} + O\n      = 2Fe^{+++}, 3SO_{4}^{--} + H_{2}O.",
  "Hydrogen ions have been oxidized to water, while the charge of each iron\nion has been increased from 2 to 3.",
  "In a similar way the conversion of ferrous chloride into ferric chloride\nmay be written",
  "Fe^{++}, 2Cl^{-} + Cl = Fe^{+++}, + 3Cl^{-}.",
  "Here again the valence of the iron and the charge on the iron ion has\nbeen increased from 2 to 3, though no oxygen has entered into the\nreaction. As a rule, however, changes of this kind are brought about by\nthe use of an oxidizing agent, and are called oxidations.",
  "The term \"oxidation\" is applied to all reactions in which the valence of\nthe metal of a compound is increased, or, in other words, to all\nreactions in which the charge of a cation is increased.",
  "~Reduction of ferric salts.~ The changes which take place when a ferric\nsalt is converted into a ferrous salt are the reverse of the ones just\ndescribed. This is seen in the equation",
  "FeCl_{3} + H = FeCl_{2} + HCl",
  "In this reaction the valence of the iron has been changed from 3 to 2.\nThe same equation may be written",
  "Fe^{+++}, 3Cl_{-} + H = Fe^{++}, + H^{+} + 3Cl_{-}",
  "It will be seen that the charge of the iron ions has been diminished\nfrom 3 to 2. Since these changes are the reverse of the oxidation\nchanges just considered, they are called reduction reactions. The term\n\"reduction\" is applied to all processes in which the valence of the\nmetal of a compound is diminished, or, in other words, to all processes\nin which the charge on the cations is diminished.",
  "NICKEL AND COBALT",
  "These elements occur sparingly in nature, usually combined with arsenic\nor with arsenic and sulphur. Both elements have been found in the free\nstate in meteorites. Like iron they form two series of compounds, but\nthe salts corresponding to the ferrous salts are the most common, the\nones corresponding to the ferric salts being difficult to obtain. Thus\nwe have the chlorides NiCl_{2}·6H_{2}O and CoCl_{2}·6H_{2}O; the\nsulphates NiSO_{4}·7H_{2}O and CoSO_{4}·7H_{2}O; the nitrates\nNi(NO_{3})_{2}·6H_{2}O and Co(NO_{3})_{2}·6H_{2}O.",
  "Nickel is largely used as an alloy with other metals. Alloyed with\ncopper it forms coin metal from which five-cent pieces are made, with\ncopper and zinc it forms German silver, and when added to steel in small\nquantities nickel steel is formed which is much superior to common steel\nfor certain purposes. When deposited by electrolysis upon the surface of\nother metals such as iron, it forms a covering which will take a high\npolish and protects the metal from rust, nickel not being acted upon by\nmoist air. Salts of nickel are usually green.",
  "Compounds of cobalt fused with glass give it an intensely blue color. In\npowdered form such glass is sometimes used as a pigment called smalt.\nCobalt salts, which contain water of crystallization, are usually cherry\nred in color; when dehydrated they become blue.",

  "~The family.~ By referring to the periodic arrangement of the elements\n(page 168), it will be seen that mercury is not included in the same\nfamily with copper and silver. Since the metallurgy of the three\nelements is so similar, however, and since they resemble each other so\nclosely in chemical properties, it is convenient to class them together\nfor study.",
  "1. _Occurrence._ The three elements occur in nature to some extent in\nthe free state, but are usually found as sulphides. Their ores are easy\nto reduce.",
  "2. _Properties._ They are heavy metals of high luster and are especially\ngood conductors of heat and electricity. They are not very active\nchemically. Neither hydrochloric nor dilute sulphuric acid has any\nappreciable action upon them. Concentrated sulphuric acid attacks all\nthree, forming metallic sulphates and evolving sulphur dioxide, while\nnitric acid, both dilute and concentrated, converts them into nitrates\nwith the evolution of oxides of nitrogen.",
  "3. _Two series of salts._ Copper and mercury form oxides of the types\nM_{2}O and MO, as well as two series of salts. In one series the metals\nare univalent and the salts have formulas like those of the sodium\nsalts. They are called cuprous and mercurous salts. In the other series\nthe metals are divalent and resemble magnesium salts in formulas. These\nare called cupric and mercuric salts. Silver forms only one series of\nsalts, being always a univalent metal.",
  "COPPER",
  "~Occurrence.~ The element copper has been used for various purposes since\nthe earliest days of history. It is often found in the metallic state in\nnature, large masses of it occurring pure in the Lake Superior region\nand in other places to a smaller extent. The most valuable ores are the\nfollowing:",
  "Cuprite         Cu_{2}O.\n    Chalcocite      Cu_{2}S.\n    Chalcopyrite    CuFeS_{2}.\n    Bornite         Cu_{3}FeS_{3}.\n    Malachite       CuCO_{3}·Cu(OH)_{2}.\n    Azurite         2CuCO_{3}·Cu(OH)_{2}.",
  "~Metallurgy of copper.~ Ores containing little or no sulphur are easy to\nreduce. They are first crushed and the earthy impurities washed away.\nThe concentrated ore is then mixed with carbon and heated in a furnace,\nmetallic copper resulting from the reduction of the copper oxide by the\nhot carbon.",
  "~Metallurgy of sulphide ores.~ Much of the copper of commerce is\n     made from chalcopyrite and bornite, and these ores are more\n     difficult to work. They are first roasted in the air, by which\n     treatment much of the sulphur is burned to sulphur dioxide. The\n     roasted ore is then melted in a small blast furnace or in an\n     open one like a puddling furnace. In melting, part of the iron\n     combines with silica to form a slag of iron silicate. The\n     product, called crude matte, contains about 50% copper together\n     with sulphur and iron. Further purification is commonly carried\n     on by a process very similar to the Bessemer process for steel.\n     The converter is lined with silica, and a charge of matte from\n     the melting furnace, together with sand, is introduced, and air\n     is blown into the mass. By this means the sulphur is\n     practically all burned out by the air, and the remaining iron\n     combines with silica and goes off as slag. The copper is poured\n     out of the converter and molded into anode plates for refining.",
  "~Refining of copper.~ Impure copper is purified by electrolysis. A large\nplate of it, serving as an anode, is suspended in a tank facing a thin\nplate of pure copper, which is the cathode. The tank is filled with a\nsolution of copper sulphate and sulphuric acid to serve as the\nelectrolyte. A current from a dynamo passes from the anode to the\ncathode, and the copper, dissolving from the anode, is deposited upon\nthe cathode in pure form, while the impurities collect on the bottom of\nthe tank. Electrolytic copper is one of the purest of commercial metals\nand is very nearly pure copper.",
  "~Recovery of gold and silver.~ Gold and silver are often present\n     in small quantities in copper ores, and in electrolytic\n     refining these metals collect in the muddy deposit on the\n     bottom of the tank. The mud is carefully worked over from time\n     to time and the precious metals extracted from it. A surprising\n     amount of gold and silver is obtained in this way.",
  "~Properties of copper.~ Copper is a rather heavy metal of density 8.9, and\nhas a characteristic reddish color. It is rather soft and is very\nmalleable, ductile, and flexible, yet tough and strong; it melts at\n1084°. As a conductor of heat and electrical energy it is second only to\nsilver.",
  "Hydrochloric acid, dilute sulphuric acid, and fused alkalis are almost\nwithout action upon it; nitric acid and hot, concentrated sulphuric\nacid, however, readily dissolve it. In moist air it slowly becomes\ncovered with a thin layer of green basic carbonate; heated in the air it\nis easily oxidized to black copper oxide (CuO).",
  "~Uses.~ Copper is extensively used for electrical purposes, for roofs and\ncornices, for sheathing the bottom of ships, and for making alloys. In\nthe following table the composition of some of these alloys is\nindicated:",
  "COMPOSITION OF ALLOYS OF COPPER IN PERCENTAGES",
  "Aluminium bronze copper (90 to 97%), aluminium (3 to 10%).\n    Brass copper (63 to 73%), zinc (27 to 37%).\n    Bronze copper (70 to 95%), zinc (1 to 25%), tin (1 to 18%).\n    German silver copper (56 to 60%), zinc (20%), nickel (20 to 25%).\n    Gold coin copper (10%), gold (90%).\n    Gun metal copper (90%), tin (10%).\n    Nickel coin copper (75%), nickel (25%)\n    Silver coin copper (10%), silver (90%).",
  "~Electrotyping.~ Matter is often printed from electrotype plates\n     which are prepared as follows. The matter is set up in type and\n     wax is firmly pressed down upon the face of it until a clear\n     impression is obtained. The impressed side of the wax is coated\n     with graphite and the impression is made the cathode in an\n     electrolytic cell containing a copper salt in solution. When\n     connected with a current the copper is deposited as a thin\n     sheet upon the letters in wax, and when detached is a perfect\n     copy of the type, the under part of the letters being hollow.\n     The sheet is strengthened by pouring on the under surface a\n     suitable amount of molten metal (commercial lead is used). The\n     sheet so strengthened is then used in printing.",
  "~Two series of copper compounds.~ Copper, like iron, forms two series of\ncompounds: in the cuprous compounds it is univalent; in the cupric it is\ndivalent. The cupric salts are much the more common of the two, since\nthe cuprous salts pass readily into cupric by oxidation.",
  "~Cuprous compounds.~ The most important cuprous compound is the oxide\n(Cu_{2}O), which occurs in nature as ruby copper or cuprite. It is a\nbright red substance and can easily be prepared by heating copper to a\nhigh temperature in a limited supply of air. It is used for imparting a\nruby color to glass.",
  "By treating cuprous oxide with different acids a number of cuprous salts\ncan be made. Many of these are insoluble in water, the chloride (CuCl)\nbeing the best known. When suspended in dilute hydrochloric acid it is\nchanged into cupric chloride, the oxygen taking part in the reaction\nbeing absorbed from the air:",
  "2CuCl + 2HCl + O = 2CuCl_{2} + H_{2}O.",
  "~Cupric compounds.~ Cupric salts are easily made by dissolving cupric\noxide in acids, or, when insoluble, by precipitation. Most of them are\nblue or green in color, and the soluble ones crystallize well. Since\nthey are so much more familiar than the cuprous salts, they are\nfrequently called merely copper salts.",
  "~Cupric oxide~ (CuO). This is a black insoluble substance obtained by\nheating copper in excess of air, or by igniting the hydroxide or\nnitrate. It is used as an oxidizing agent.",
  "~Cupric hydroxide~ (Cu(OH)_{2}). The hydroxide prepared by treating a\nsolution of a copper salt with sodium hydroxide is a light blue\ninsoluble substance which easily loses water and changes into the oxide.\nHeat applied to the liquid containing the hydroxide suspended in it\nserves to bring about the reaction represented by the equation",
  "Cu(OH)_{2} = CuO + H_{2}O.",
  "~Cupric sulphate~ (_blue vitriol_) (CuSO_{4}·5H_{2}O). This substance,\ncalled blue vitriol or bluestone, is obtained as a by-product in a\nnumber of processes and is produced in very large quantities. It forms\nlarge blue crystals, which lose water when heated and crumble to a white\npowder. The salt finds many uses, especially in electrotyping and in\nmaking electrical batteries.",
  "~Cupric sulphide~ (CuS). The insoluble black sulphide (CuS) is easily\nprepared by the action of hydrosulphuric acid upon a solution of a\ncopper salt:",
  "CuSO_{4} + H_{2}S = CuS + H_{2}SO_{4}.",
  "It is insoluble in water and dilute acids.",
  "MERCURY",
  "~Occurrence.~ Mercury occurs in nature chiefly as the sulphide (HgS)\ncalled cinnabar, and in globules of metal inclosed in the cinnabar. The\nmercury mines of Spain have long been famous, California being the next\nlargest producer.",
  "~Metallurgy.~ Mercury is a volatile metal which has but little affinity\nfor oxygen. Sulphur, on the other hand, readily combines with oxygen.\nThese facts make the metallurgy of mercury very simple. The crushed ore,\nmixed with a small amount of carbon to reduce any oxide or sulphate that\nmight be formed, is roasted in a current of air. The sulphur burns to\nsulphur dioxide, while the mercury is converted into vapor and is\ncondensed in a series of condensing vessels. The metal is purified by\ndistillation.",
  "~Properties.~ Mercury is a heavy silvery liquid with a density of 13.596.\nIt boils at 357° and solidifies at -39.5°. Small quantities of many\nmetals dissolve in it, forming liquid alloys, while with larger\nquantities it forms solid alloys. The alloys of mercury are called\namalgams.",
  "Toward acids mercury conducts itself very much like copper; it is easily\nattacked by nitric and hot, concentrated sulphuric acids, while cold\nsulphuric and hydrochloric acids have no effect on it.",
  "~Uses.~ Mercury is extensively used in the construction of scientific\ninstruments, such as the thermometer and barometer, and as a liquid over\nwhich to collect gases which are soluble in water. The readiness with\nwhich it alloys with silver and gold makes it very useful in the\nextraction of these elements.",
  "~Compounds of mercury.~ Like copper, mercury forms two series of\ncompounds: the mercurous, of which mercurous chloride (HgCl) is an\nexample; and the mercuric, represented by mercuric chloride (HgCl_{2}).",
  "~Mercuric oxide~ (HgO). Mercuric oxide can be obtained either as a\nbrick-red or as a yellow substance. When mercuric nitrate is heated\ncarefully the red modification is formed in accordance with the equation",
  "Hg(NO_{3})_{2} = HgO + 2NO_{2} + O.",
  "The yellow modification is prepared by adding a solution of a mercuric\nsalt to a solution of sodium or potassium hydroxide:",
  "Hg(NO_{3})_{2} + 2NaOH = 2NaNO_{3} + Hg(OH)_{2},",
  "Hg(OH)_{2} = HgO + H_{2}O.",
  "When heated the oxide darkens until it becomes almost black; at a higher\ntemperature it decomposes into mercury and oxygen. It was by this\nreaction that oxygen was discovered.",
  "~Mercurous chloride~ (_calomel_) (HgCl). Being insoluble, mercurous\nchloride is precipitated as a white solid when a soluble chloride is\nadded to a solution of mercurous nitrate:",
  "HgNO_{3} + NaCl = HgCl + NaNO_{3}.",
  "Commercially it is manufactured by heating a mixture of mercuric\nchloride and mercury. When exposed to the light it slowly changes into\nmercuric chloride and mercury:",
  "2HgCl = HgCl_{2} + Hg.",
  "It is therefore protected from the light by the use of colored bottles.\nIt is used in medicine.",
  "Most mercurous salts are insoluble in water, the principal soluble one\nbeing the nitrate, which is made by the action of cold, dilute nitric\nacid on mercury.",
  "~Mercuric chloride~ (_corrosive sublimate_) (HgCl_{2}). This substance can\nbe made by dissolving mercuric oxide in hydrochloric acid. On a\ncommercial scale it is made by subliming a mixture of common salt and\nmercuric sulphate:",
  "2NaCl + HgSO_{4} = HgCl_{2} + Na_{2}SO_{4}.",
  "The mercuric chloride, being readily volatile, vaporizes and is\ncondensed again in cool vessels. Like mercurous chloride it is a white\nsolid, but differs from it in that it is soluble in water. It is\nextremely poisonous and in dilute solutions is used as an antiseptic in\ndressing wounds.",
  "~Mercuric sulphide~ (HgS). As cinnabar this substance forms the chief\nnative compound of mercury, occurring in red crystalline masses. By\npassing hydrosulphuric acid into a solution of a mercuric salt it is\nprecipitated as a black powder, insoluble in water and acids. By other\nmeans it can be prepared as a brilliant red powder known as vermilion,\nwhich is used as a pigment in fine paints.",
  "~The iodides of mercury.~ If a solution of potassium iodide is\n     added to solutions of a mercurous and a mercuric salt\n     respectively, the corresponding iodides are precipitated.\n     Mercuric iodide is the more important of the two, and as\n     prepared above is a red powder which changes to yellow on\n     heating to 150°. The yellow form on cooling changes back again\n     to the red form, or may be made to do so by rubbing it with a\n     knife blade or some other hard object.",
  "SILVER",
  "~Occurrence.~ Silver is found in small quantities in the uncombined state;\nusually, however, it occurs in combination with sulphur, either as the\nsulphide (Ag_{2}S) or as a small constituent of other sulphides,\nespecially those of lead and copper. It is also found alloyed with gold.",
  "~Metallurgy.~ _Parkes's process._ Silver is usually smelted in connection\nwith lead. The ores are worked over together, as described under lead,\nand the lead and silver obtained as an alloy, the silver being present\nin small quantity. The alloy is melted and metallic zinc is stirred in.\nZinc will alloy with silver but not with lead, and it is found that the\nsilver leaves the lead and, in the form of an alloy with zinc, forms as\na crust upon the lead and is skimmed off. This crust, which, of course,\ncontains lead adhering to it, is partially melted and the most of the\nlead drained off. The zinc is removed by distillation, and the residue\nis melted on an open hearth in a current of air; by this means the zinc\nand lead remaining with the silver are changed into oxides and the\nsilver remains behind unaltered.",
  "~Amalgamation process.~ In some localities the old amalgamation\n     process is used. The silver ore is treated with common salt and\n     ferrous compounds, which process converts the silver first into\n     chloride and then into metallic silver. Mercury is then added\n     and thoroughly mixed with the mass, forming an amalgam with the\n     silver. After some days the earthy materials are washed away\n     and the heavier amalgam is recovered. The mercury is distilled\n     off and the silver left in impure form.",
  "~Refining silver.~ The silver obtained by either of the above processes\nmay still contain copper, gold, and iron, and is refined by \"parting\"\nwith sulphuric acid. The metal is heated with strong sulphuric acid\nwhich dissolves the silver, copper, and iron present, but not the gold.\nIn the solution of silver sulphate so obtained copper plates are\nsuspended, upon which the pure silver precipitates, the copper going\ninto solution as sulphate, as shown in the equation",
  "Ag_{2}SO_{4} + Cu = 2Ag + CuSO_{4}.",
  "The solution obtained as a by-product in this process furnishes most of\nthe blue vitriol of commerce. Silver is also refined by electrolytic\nmethods similar to those used in refining copper.",
  "~Properties of silver.~ Silver is a heavy, rather soft, white metal, very\nductile and malleable and capable of taking a high polish. It surpasses\nall other metals as a conductor of heat and electricity, but is too\ncostly to find extensive use for such purposes. It melts at a little\nlower temperature than copper (961°). It alloys readily with other heavy\nmetals, and when it is to be used for coinage a small amount of\ncopper--from 8 to 10%--is nearly always melted with it to give it\nhardness.",
  "It is not acted upon by water or air, but is quickly tarnished when in\ncontact with sulphur compounds, turning quite black in time.\nHydrochloric acid and fused alkalis do not act upon it, but nitric acid\nand hot, concentrated sulphuric acid dissolve it with ease.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 88]",
  "~Electroplating.~ Since silver is not acted upon by water or air,\n     and has a pleasing appearance, it is used to coat various\n     articles made of cheaper metals. Such articles are said to be\n     silver plated. The process by which this is done is called\n     electroplating. It is carried on as follows: The object to be\n     plated (such as a spoon) is attached to a wire and dipped into\n     a solution of a silver salt. Electrical connection is made in\n     such a way that the article to be plated serves as the cathode,\n     while the anode is made up of one or more plates of silver\n     (Fig. 88, A). When a current is passed through the\n     electrolyte silver dissolves from the anode plate and deposits\n     on the cathode in the form of a closely adhering layer. By\n     making the proper change in the electrolyte and anode plate\n     objects may be plated with gold and other metals.",
  "~Compounds of silver.~ Silver forms two oxides but only one series of\nsalts, namely, the one which corresponds to the mercurous and cuprous\nseries.",
  "~Silver nitrate~ (_lunar caustic_) (AgNO_{3}). This salt is easily\nprepared by dissolving silver in nitric acid and evaporating the\nresulting solution. It crystallizes in flat plates, and when heated\ncarefully can be melted without decomposition. When cast into sticks it\nis called lunar caustic, for it has a very corrosive action on flesh,\nand is sometimes used in surgery to burn away abnormal growths.",
  "The alchemists designated the metals by the names of the\n     heavenly bodies. The moon (luna) was the symbol for silver;\n     hence the name \"lunar caustic.\"",
  "~Silver sulphide~ (Ag_{2}S). This occurs in nature and constitutes one of\nthe principal ores of silver. It can be obtained in the form of a black\nsolid by passing hydrosulphuric acid through a solution of silver\nnitrate.",
  "~Compounds of silver with the halogens.~ The chloride, bromide, and iodide\nof silver are insoluble in water and acids, and are therefore\nprecipitated by bringing together a soluble halogen salt with silver\nnitrate:",
  "AgNO_{3} + KCl = AgCl + KNO_{3}.",
  "They are remarkable for the fact that they are very sensitive to the\naction of light, undergoing a change of color and chemical composition\nwhen exposed to sunlight, especially if in contact with organic matter\nsuch as gelatin.",
  "~Photography.~ The art of photography is based on the fact that\n     the halogen compounds of silver are affected by the light,\n     particularly in the presence of organic matter. From a chemical\n     standpoint the processes involved may be described under two\n     heads: (1) the preparation of the negative; (2) the preparation\n     of the print.",
  "1. _Preparation of the negative._ The plate used in the\n     preparation of the negative is made by spreading a thin layer\n     of gelatin, in which silver bromide is suspended (silver iodide\n     is sometimes added also), over a glass plate or celluloid film\n     and allowing it to dry. When the plate so prepared is placed in\n     a camera and the image of some object is focused upon it, the\n     silver salt undergoes a change which is proportional at each\n     point to the intensity of the light falling upon it. In this\n     way an image of the object photographed is produced upon the\n     plate, which is, however, invisible and is therefore called\n     \"latent.\" It can be made visible by the process of developing.",
  "To develop the image the exposed plate is immersed in a\n     solution of some reducing agent called the developer. The\n     developer reduces that portion of the silver salt which has\n     been affected by the light, depositing it in the form of black\n     metallic silver which closely adheres to the plate.",
  "The unaffected silver salt, upon which the developer has no\n     action, must now be removed from the plate. This is done by\n     immersing the plate in a solution of sodium thiosulphate\n     (hypo). After the silver salt has been dissolved off, the plate\n     is washed with water and dried. The plate so prepared is\n     called the negative because it is a picture of the object\n     photographed, with the lights exactly reversed. This is called\n     fixing the negative.",
  "2. _Preparation of the print._ The print is made from paper\n     which is prepared in the same way as the negative plate. The\n     negative is placed upon this paper and exposed to the light in\n     such a way that the light must pass through the negative before\n     striking the paper. If the paper is coated with silver\n     chloride, a visible image is produced, in which case a\n     developer is not needed. The proofs are made in this way. In\n     order to make them permanent the unchanged silver chloride must\n     be dissolved off with sodium thiosulphate. The print is then\n     toned by dipping it into a solution of gold or platinum salts.\n     The silver on the print passes into solution, while the gold or\n     platinum takes its place. These metals give a characteristic\n     color or tone to the print, the gold making it reddish brown,\n     while the platinum gives it a steel-gray tone. If a silver\n     bromide paper is used in making the print, a latent image is\n     produced which must be developed as in the case of the negative\n     itself. The silver bromide is much more sensitive than the\n     chloride, so that the printing can be done in artificial light.\n     Since the darkest places on the negative cut off the most\n     light, it is evident that the lights of the print will be the\n     reverse of those of the negative, and will therefore correspond\n     to those of the object photographed. The print is therefore\n     called the positive.",

  "~Occurrence.~ Tin is found in nature chiefly as the oxide (SnO_{2}),\ncalled cassiterite or tinstone. The most famous mines are those of\nCornwall in England, and of the Malay Peninsula and East India Islands;\nin small amounts tinstone is found in many other localities.",
  "~Metallurgy.~ The metallurgy of tin is very simple. The ore, separated as\nfar as possible from earthy materials, is mixed with carbon and heated\nin a furnace, the reduction taking place readily. The equation is",
  "SnO_{2} + C = Sn + CO_{2}.",
  "The metal is often purified by carefully heating it until it is partly\nmelted; the pure tin melts first and can be drained away from the\nimpurities.",
  "~Properties.~ Pure tin, called block tin, is a soft white metal with a\nsilver-like appearance and luster; it melts readily (235°) and is\nsomewhat lighter than copper, having a density of 7.3. It is quite\nmalleable and can be rolled out into very thin sheets, forming tin foil;\nmost tin foil, however, contains a good deal of lead.",
  "Under ordinary conditions it is quite unchanged by air or moisture, but\nat a high temperature it burns in air, forming the oxide SnO_{2}. Dilute\nacids have no effect upon it, but concentrated acids attack it readily.\nConcentrated hydrochloric acid changes it into the chloride",
  "Sn + 2HCl = SnCl_{2} + 2H.",
  "With sulphuric acid tin sulphate and sulphur dioxide are formed:",
  "Sn + 2H_{2}SO_{4} = SnSO_{4} + SO_{2} + 2H_{2}O",
  "Concentrated nitric acid oxidizes it, forming a white insoluble compound\nof the formula H_{2}SnO_{3}, called metastannic acid:",
  "3Sn + 4HNO_{3} + H_{2}O = 3H_{2}SnO_{3} + 4NO.",
  "~Uses of tin.~ A great deal of tin is made into tin plate by dipping thin\nsteel sheets into the melted metal. Owing to the way in which tin\nresists the action of air and dilute acids, tin plate is used in many\nways, such as in roofing, and in the manufacture of tin cans, cooking\nvessels, and similar articles.",
  "Many useful alloys contain tin, some of which have been mentioned in\nconnection with copper. When tin is alloyed with other metals of low\nmelting point, soft, easily melted alloys are formed which are used for\nfriction bearings in machinery; tin, antimony, lead, and bismuth are the\nchief constituents of these alloys. Pewter and soft solder are alloys of\ntin and lead.",
  "~Compounds of tin.~ Tin forms two series of compounds: the stannous, in\nwhich the tin is divalent, illustrated in the compounds SnO, SnS,\nSnCl_{2}; the stannic, in which it is tetravalent as shown in the\ncompounds SnO_{2}, SnS_{2}. There is also an acid, H_{2}SnO_{3}, called\nstannic acid, which forms a series of salts called stannates. While this\nacid has the same composition as metastannic acid, the two are quite\ndifferent in their chemical properties. This difference is probably due\nto the different arrangement of the atoms in the molecules of the two\nsubstances. Only a few compounds of tin need be mentioned.",
  "~Stannic oxide~ (SnO_{2}). Stannic oxide is of interest, since it is the\nchief compound of tin found in nature. It is sometimes found in\ngood-sized crystals, but as prepared in the laboratory is a white\npowder. When fused with potassium hydroxide it forms potassium stannate,\nacting very much like silicon dioxide:",
  "SnO_{2} + 2KOH = K_{2}SnO_{3} + H_{2}O.",
  "~Chlorides of tin.~ Stannous chloride is prepared by dissolving tin in\nconcentrated hydrochloric acid and evaporating the solution to\ncrystallization. The crystals which are obtained have the composition\nSnCl_{2}·2H_{2}O, and are known as tin crystals. By treating a solution\nof stannous chloride with aqua regia, stannic chloride is formed:",
  "SnCl_{2} + 2Cl = SnCl_{4}.",
  "The salt which crystallizes from such a solution has the composition\nSnCl_{4}·5H_{2}O, and is known commercially as oxymuriate of tin. If\nmetallic tin is heated in a current of dry chlorine, the anhydrous\nchloride (SnCl_{4}) is obtained as a heavy colorless liquid which fumes\nstrongly on exposure to air.",
  "The ease with which stannous chloride takes up chlorine to form stannic\nchloride makes it a good reducing agent in many reactions, changing the\nhigher chlorides of metals to lower ones. Thus mercuric chloride is\nchanged into mercurous chloride:",
  "SnCl_{2} + 2HgCl_{2} = SnCl_{4} + 2HgCl.",
  "If the stannous chloride is in excess, the reaction may go further,\nproducing metallic mercury:",
  "SnCl_{2} + 2HgCl = SnCl_{4} + 2Hg.",
  "Ferric chloride is in like manner reduced to ferrous chloride:",
  "SnCl_{3} + 2FeCl_{3} = SnCl_{4} + 2FeCl_{2}.",
  "The chlorides of tin, as well as the alkali stannates, are much used as\nmordants in dyeing processes. The hydroxides of tin and free stannic\nacid, which are easily liberated from these compounds, possess in very\nmarked degree the power of fixing dyes upon fibers, as explained under\naluminium.",
  "LEAD",
  "~Occurrence.~ Lead is found in nature chiefly as the sulphide (PbS),\ncalled galena; to a much smaller extent it occurs as carbonate,\nsulphate, chromate, and in a few other forms. Practically all the lead\nof commerce is made from galena, two general methods of metallurgy being\nin use.",
  "~Metallurgy.~ 1. The sulphide is melted with scrap iron, when iron\nsulphide and metallic lead are formed; the liquid lead, being the\nheavier, sinks to the bottom of the vessel and can be drawn off:",
  "PbS + Fe = Pb + FeS.",
  "2. The sulphide is roasted in the air until a part of it has been\nchanged into oxide and sulphate. The air is then shut off and the\nheating continued, the reactions indicated in the following equations\ntaking place:",
  "2PbO + PbS = 3Pb + SO_{2},",
  "PbSO_{4} + PbS = 2Pb + 2SO_{2}.",
  "The lead so prepared usually contains small amounts of silver, arsenic,\nantimony, copper, and other metals. The silver is removed by Parkes's\nmethod, as described under silver, and the other metals in various ways.\nThe lead of commerce is one of the purest commercial metals, containing\nas a rule only a few tenths per cent of impurities.",
  "~Properties.~ Lead is a heavy metal (den. = 11.33) which has a brilliant\nsilvery luster on a freshly cut surface, but which soon tarnishes to a\ndull blue-gray color. It is soft, easily fused (melting at 327°), and\nquite malleable, but has little toughness or strength.",
  "It is not acted upon to any great extent by the oxygen of the air under\nordinary conditions, but is changed into oxide at a high temperature.\nWith the exception of hydrochloric and sulphuric acids, most acids, even\nvery weak ones, act upon it, forming soluble lead salts. Hot,\nconcentrated hydrochloric and sulphuric acids also attack it to a slight\nextent.",
  "~Uses.~ Lead is employed in the manufacture of lead pipes and in large\nstorage batteries. In the form of sheet lead it is used in lining the\nchambers of sulphuric acid works and in the preparation of paint\npigments. Some alloys of lead, such as solder and pewter (lead and tin),\nshot (lead and arsenic), and soft bearing metals, are widely used. Type\nmetal consists of lead, antimony, and sometimes tin. Compounds of lead\nform several important pigments.",
  "~Compounds of lead.~ In nearly all its compounds lead has a valence of 2,\nbut a few corresponding to stannic compounds have a valence of 4.",
  "~Lead oxides.~ Lead forms a number of oxides, the most important of which\nare litharge, red lead or minium, and lead peroxide.",
  "1. _Litharge_ (PbO). This oxide forms when lead is oxidized at a rather\nlow temperature, and is obtained as a by-product in silver refining. It\nis a pale yellow powder, and has a number of commercial uses. It is\neasily soluble in nitric acid:",
  "PbO + 2HNO_{3} = Pb(NO_{3})_{2} + H_{2}O.",
  "2. _Red lead, or minium_ (Pb_{3}O_{4}). Minium is prepared by heating\nlead (or litharge) to a high temperature in the air. It is a heavy\npowder of a beautiful red color, and is much used as a pigment.",
  "3. _Lead peroxide_ (PbO_{2}). This is left as a residue when minium is\nheated with nitric acid:",
  "Pb_{3}O_{4} + 4HNO_{3} = 2Pb(NO_{3})_{2} + PbO_{2} + 2H_{2}O.",
  "It is a brown powder which easily gives up a part of its oxygen and,\nlike manganese dioxide and barium dioxide, is a good oxidizing agent.",
  "~Soluble salts of lead.~ The soluble salts of lead can be made by dissolving\n(Pb(C_{2}H_{3}O_{2})_{2}·3H_{2}O), litharge in acids. Lead acetate\ncalled sugar of lead, and lead nitrate (Pb(NO_{3})_{2}) are the most\nfamiliar examples. They are while crystalline solids and are poisonous\nin character.",
  "~Insoluble salts of lead; lead carbonate.~ While the normal carbonate of\nlead (PbCO_{3}) is found to some extent, in nature and can be prepared\nin the laboratory, basic carbonates of varying composition are much more\neasy to obtain. One of the simplest of these has the composition\n2PbCO_{3}·Pb(OH)_{2}. A mixture of such carbonates is called white lead.\nThis is prepared on a large scale as a paint pigment and as a body for\npaints which are to be colored with other substances.",
  "~White lead.~ White lead is an amorphous white substance which,\n     when mixed with oil, has great covering power, that is, it\n     spreads out in an even waxy film, free from streaks and lumps,\n     and covers the entire surface upon which it is spread. Its\n     disadvantage as a pigment lies in the fact that it gradually\n     blackens when exposed to sulphur compounds, which are often\n     present in the air, forming black lead sulphide (PbS).",
  "~Technical preparation of white lead.~ Different methods are used\n     in the preparation of white lead, but the old one known as the\n     Dutch process is still the principal one employed. In this\n     process, earthenware pots about ten inches high and of the\n     shape shown in Fig. 89 are used. In the bottom A is placed a\n     3% solution of acetic acid (vinegar answers the purpose very\n     well). The space above this is filled with thin, perforated,\n     circular pieces of lead, supported by the flange B of the\n     pot. These pots are placed close together on a bed of tan bark\n     on the floor of a room known as the corroding room. They are\n     covered over with boards, upon which tan bark is placed, and\n     another row of pots is placed on this. In this way the room is\n     filled. The white lead is formed by the fumes of the acetic\n     acid, together with the carbon dioxide set free in the\n     fermentation of the tan bark acting on the lead. About three\n     months are required to complete the process.",
  "[Illustration 1: Fig. 89]",
  "~Lead sulphide~ (PbS). In nature this compound occurs in highly\ncrystalline condition, the crystals having much the same luster as pure\nlead. It is readily prepared in the laboratory as a black precipitate,\nby the action of hydrosulphuric acid upon soluble lead salts:",
  "Pb(NO_{3})_{2} + H_{2}S = PbS + 2HNO_{3}.",
  "It is insoluble both in water and in dilute acids.",
  "~Other insoluble salts.~ Lead chromate (PbCrO_{4}) is a yellow substance\nproduced by the action of a soluble lead salt upon a soluble chromate,\nthus:",
  "K_{2}CrO_{4} + Pb(NO_{3})_{2} = PbCrO_{4} + 2 KNO_{3}.",
  "It is used as a yellow pigment. Lead sulphate (PbSO_{4}) is a white\nsubstance sometimes found in nature and easily prepared by\nprecipitation. Lead chloride (PbCl_{2}) is likewise a white substance\nnearly insoluble in cold water, but readily soluble in boiling water.",
  "~Thorium and cerium.~ These elements are found in a few rare\n     minerals, especially in the monazite sand of the Carolinas and\n     Brazil. The oxides of these elements are used in the\n     preparation of the Welsbach mantles for gas lights, because of\n     the intense light given out when a mixture of the oxides is\n     heated. These mantles contain the oxides of cerium and thorium\n     in the ratio of about 1% of the former to 99% of the latter.\n     Compounds of thorium, like those of radium, are found to\n     possess radio-activity, but in a less degree.",

  "~General.~ Manganese and chromium, while belonging to different families,\nhave so many features in common in their chemical conduct that they may\nbe studied together with advantage. They differ from most of the\nelements so far studied in that they can act either as acid-forming or\nbase-forming elements. As base-forming elements each of the metals forms\ntwo series of salts. In the one series, designated by the suffix \"ous,\"\nthe metal is divalent; in the other series, designated by the suffix\n\"ic,\" the metal is trivalent. Only the manganous and the chromic salts,\nhowever, are of importance. The acids in which these elements play the\npart of a non-metal are unstable, but their salts are usually stable,\nand some of them are important compounds.",
  "MANGANESE",
  "~Occurrence.~ Manganese is found in nature chiefly as the dioxide MnO_{2},\ncalled pyrolusite. In smaller amounts it occurs as the oxides\nMn_{2}O_{3} and Mn_{3}O_{4}, and as the carbonate MnCO_{3}. Some iron\nores also contain manganese.",
  "~Preparation and properties.~ The element is difficult to prepare in pure\ncondition and has no commercial applications. It can be prepared,\nhowever, by reducing the oxide with aluminium powder or by the use of\nthe electric furnace, with carbon as the reducing agent. The metal\nsomewhat resembles iron in appearance, but is harder, less fusible, and\nmore readily acted upon by air and moisture. Acids readily dissolve it,\nforming manganous salts.",
  "~Oxides of manganese.~ The following oxides of manganese are known: MnO,\nMn_{2}O_{3}, Mn_{3}O_{4}, MnO_{2}, and Mn_{2}O_{7}. Only one of these,\nthe dioxide, needs special mention.",
  "~Manganese dioxide~ (_pyrolusite_) (MnO_{2}). This substance is the most\nabundant manganese compound found in nature, and is the ore from which\nall other compounds of manganese are made. It is a hard, brittle, black\nsubstance which is valuable as an oxidizing agent. It will be recalled\nthat it is used in the preparation of chlorine and oxygen, in\ndecolorizing glass which contains iron, and in the manufacture of\nferromanganese.",
  "~Compounds containing manganese as a base-forming element.~ As has been\nstated previously, manganese forms two series of salts. The most\nimportant of these salts, all of which belong to the manganous series,\nare the following:",
  "Manganous chloride           MnCl_{2}·4H_{2}O.\n    Manganous sulphide           MnS.\n    Manganous sulphate           MnSO_{4}·4H_{2}O.\n    Manganous carbonate          MnCO_{3}.\n    Manganous hydroxide          Mn(OH)_{2}.",
  "The chloride and sulphate may be prepared by heating the dioxide with\nhydrochloric and sulphuric acids respectively:",
  "MnO_{2} + 4HCl = MnCl_{2} + 2H_{2}O + 2Cl,",
  "MnO_{2} + H_{2}SO_{4} = MnSO_{4} + H_{2}O + O.",
  "The sulphide, carbonate, and hydroxide, being insoluble, may be prepared\nfrom a solution of the chloride or sulphate by precipitation with the\nappropriate reagents. Most of the manganous salts are rose colored. They\nnot only have formulas similar to the ferrous salts, but resemble them\nin many of their chemical properties.",
  "~Compounds containing manganese as an acid-forming element.~ Manganese\nforms two unstable acids, namely, manganic acid and permanganic acid.\nWhile these acids are of little interest, some of their salts,\nespecially the permanganates, are important compounds.",
  "~Manganic acid and manganates.~ When manganese dioxide is fused with an\nalkali and an oxidizing agent a green compound is formed. The equation,\nwhen caustic potash is used, is as follows:",
  "MnO_{2} + 2KOH + O = K_{2}MnO_{4} + H_{2}O.",
  "The green compound (K_{2}MnO_{4}) is called potassium manganate, and is\na salt of the unstable manganic acid (H_{2}MnO_{4}). The manganates are\nall very unstable.",
  "~Permanganic acid and the permanganates.~ When carbon dioxide is passed\nthrough a solution of a manganate a part of the manganese is changed\ninto manganese dioxide, while the remainder forms a salt of the unstable\nacid HMnO_{4}, called permanganic acid. The equation is",
  "3K_{2}MnO_{4} + 2CO_{2} = MnO_{2} + 2KMnO_{4} + 2K_{2}CO_{3}.",
  "Potassium permanganate (KMnO_{4}) crystallizes in purple-black needles\nand is very soluble in water, forming an intensely purple solution. All\nother permanganates, as well as permanganic acid itself, give solutions\nof the same color.",
  "~Oxidizing properties of the permanganates.~ The permanganates are\nremarkable for their strong oxidizing properties. When used as an\noxidizing agent the permanganate is itself reduced, the exact character\nof the products formed from it depending upon whether the oxidation\ntakes place (1) in an alkaline or neutral solution, or (2) in an acid\nsolution.",
  "1. _Oxidation in alkaline or neutral solution._ When the solution is\neither alkaline or neutral the potassium and the manganese of the\npermanganate are both converted into hydroxides, as shown in the\nequation",
  "2KMnO_{4} + 5H_{2}O = 2Mn(OH)_{4} + 2KOH + 3O.",
  "2. _Oxidation in acid solution._ When free acid such as sulphuric is\npresent, the potassium and the manganese are both changed into salts of\nthe acid:",
  "2KMnO_{4} + 3H_{2}SO_{4} = K_{2}SO_{4} + 2MnSO_{4} + 3H_{2}O + 5O.",
  "Under ordinary conditions, however, neither one of these reactions takes\nplace except in the presence of a third substance which is capable of\noxidation. The oxygen is not given off in the free state, as the\nequations show, but is used up in effecting oxidation.",
  "Potassium permanganate is particularly valuable as an oxidizing agent\nnot only because it acts readily either in acid or in alkaline solution,\nbut also because the reaction takes place so easily that often it is not\neven necessary to heat the solution to secure action. The substance\nfinds many uses in the laboratory, especially in analytical work. It is\nalso used as an antiseptic as well as a disinfectant.",
  "CHROMIUM",
  "~Occurrence.~ The ore from which all chromium compounds are made is\nchromite, or chrome iron ore (FeCr_{2}O_{4}). This is found most\nabundantly in New Caledonia and Turkey. The element also occurs in small\nquantities in many other minerals, especially in crocoisite (PbCrO_{4}),\nin which mineral it was first discovered.",
  "~Preparation.~ Chromium, like manganese, is very hard to reduce from its\nores, owing to its great affinity for oxygen. It can, however, be made\nby the same methods which have proved successful with manganese.\nConsiderable quantities of an alloy of chromium with iron, called\nferrochromium, are now produced for the steel industry.",
  "~Properties.~ Chromium is a very hard metal of about the same density as\niron. It is one of the most infusible of the metals, requiring a\ntemperature little short of 3000° for fusion. At ordinary temperatures\nair has little action on it; at higher temperatures, however, it burns\nbrilliantly. Nitric acid has no action on it, but hydrochloric and\ndilute sulphuric acids dissolve it, liberating hydrogen.",
  "~Compounds containing chromium as a base-forming element.~ While chromium\nforms two series of salts, chromous salts are difficult to prepare and\nare of little importance. The most important of the chromic series are\nthe following:",
  "Chromic hydroxide       Cr(OH)_{3}.\n    Chromic chloride        CrCl_{3}·6H_{2}O.\n    Chromic sulphate        Cr_{2}(SO_{4})_{3}.\n    Chrome alums",
  "~Chromic hydroxide~ (Cr(OH)_{3}). This substance, being insoluble, can be\nobtained by precipitating a solution of the chloride or sulphate with a\nsoluble hydroxide. It is a greenish substance which, like aluminium\nhydroxide, dissolves in alkalis, forming soluble salts.",
  "~Dehydration of chromium hydroxide.~ When heated gently chromic\n     hydroxide loses a part of its oxygen and hydrogen, forming the\n     substance CrO·OH, which, like the corresponding aluminium\n     compound, has more pronounced acid properties than the\n     hydroxide. It forms a series of salts very similar to the\n     spinels; chromite is the ferrous salt of this acid, having the\n     formula Fe(CrO_{2})_{2}. When heated to a higher temperature\n     chromic hydroxide is completely dehydrated, forming the\n     trioxide Cr_{2}O_{3}. This resembles the corresponding oxides\n     of aluminium and iron in many respects. It is a bright green\n     powder, and when ignited strongly becomes almost insoluble in\n     acids, as is also the case with aluminium oxide.",
  "~Chromic sulphate~ (Cr_{2}(SO_{4})_{3}). This compound is a violet-colored\nsolid which dissolves in water, forming a solution of the same color.\nThis solution, however, turns green on heating, owing to the formation\nof basic salts. Chromic sulphate, like ferric and aluminium sulphates,\nunites with the sulphates of the alkali metals to form alums, of which\nthe best known are potassium chrome alum (KCr(SO_{4})_{2}·12H_{2}O) and\nammonium chrome alum (NH_{4}Cr(SO_{4})_{2}·12H_{2}O).",
  "These form beautiful dark purple crystals and have some practical uses\nin the tanning industry and in photography. A number of the salts of\nchromium are also used in the dyeing industry, for they hydrolyze like\naluminium salts and the hydroxide forms a good mordant.",
  "~Hydrolysis of chromium salts.~ When ammonium sulphide is added\n     to a solution of a chromium salt, such as the sulphate,\n     chromium hydroxide precipitates instead of the sulphide. This\n     is due to the fact that chromic sulphide, like aluminium\n     sulphide, hydrolyzes in the presence of water, forming chromic\n     hydroxide and hydrosulphuric acid. Similarly, a soluble\n     carbonate precipitates a basic carbonate of chromium.",
  "~Compounds containing chromium as an acid-forming element.~ Like\nmanganese, chromium forms two unstable acids, namely, chromic acid and\ndichromic acid. Their salts, the chromates and dichromates, are\nimportant compounds.",
  "~Chromates.~ When a chromium compound is fused with an alkali and an\noxidizing agent a chromate is produced. When potassium hydroxide is used\nas the alkali the equation is",
  "2Cr(OH)_{3} + 4KOH + 3O = 2K_{2}CrO_{4} + 5H_{2}O.",
  "This reaction recalls the formation of a manganate under similar\nconditions.",
  "~Properties of chromates.~ The chromates are salts of the unstable chromic\nacid (H_{2}CrO_{4}), and as a rule are yellow in color. Lead chromate\n(PbCrO_{4}) is the well-known pigment chrome yellow. Most of the\nchromates are insoluble and can therefore be prepared by precipitation.\nThus, when a solution of potassium chromate is added to solutions of\nlead nitrate and barium nitrate respectively, the reactions expressed by\nthe following equations occur:",
  "Pb(NO_{3})_{2} + K_{2}CrO_{4} = PbCrO_{4} + 2KNO_{3},",
  "Ba(NO_{3})_{2} + K_{2}CrO_{4} = BaCrO_{4} + 2KNO_{3}.",
  "The chromates of lead and barium separate as yellow precipitates. The\npresence of either of these two metals can be detected by taking\nadvantage of these reactions.",
  "~Dichromates.~ When potassium chromate is treated with an acid the\npotassium salt of the unstable dichromic acid (H_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7}) is\nformed:",
  "2K_{2}CrO_{4} + H_{2}SO_{4} = K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7} + K_{2}SO_{4} + H_{2}O.",
  "The relation between the chromates and dichromates is the same as that\nbetween the phosphates and the pyrophosphates. Potassium dichromate\nmight therefore be called potassium pyrochromate.",
  "~Potassium dichromate~ (K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7}). This is the best known\ndichromate, and is the most familiar chromium compound. It forms large\ncrystals of a brilliant red color, and is rather sparingly soluble in\nwater. When treated with potassium hydroxide it is converted into the\nchromate",
  "K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7} + 2KOH = 2K_{2}CrO_{4} + H_{2}O.",
  "When added to a solution of lead or barium salt the corresponding\nchromates (not dichromates) are precipitated. With barium nitrate the\nequation is",
  "2Ba(NO_{3})_{2} + K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7} + H_{2}O\n        = 2BaCrO_{4} + 2KNO_{3} + 2HNO_{3}.",
  "Potassium dichromate finds use in many industries as an oxidizing agent,\nespecially in the preparation of organic substances, such as the dye\nalizarin, and in the construction of several varieties of electric\nbatteries.",
  "~Sodium chromates.~ The reason why the potassium salt rather than\n     the sodium compound is used is that sodium chromate and\n     dichromate are so soluble that it is hard to prepare them pure.\n     This difficulty is being overcome now, and the sodium compounds\n     are replacing the corresponding potassium salts. This is of\n     advantage, since a sodium salt is cheaper than a potassium\n     salt, so far as raw materials go.",
  "~Oxidizing action of chromates and dichromates.~ When a dilute solution of\na chromate or dichromate is acidified with an acid, such as sulphuric\nacid, no reaction apparently takes place. However, if there is present a\nthird substance capable of oxidation, the chromium compound gives up a\nportion of its oxygen to this substance. Since the chromate changes into\na dichromate in the presence of an acid, it will be sufficient to study\nthe action of the dichromates alone. The reaction takes place in two\nsteps. Thus, when a solution of ferrous sulphate is added to a solution\nof potassium dichromate acidified with sulphuric acid, the reaction is\nexpressed by the following equations:",

  "(2) 6FeSO_{4} + 3H_{2}SO_{4} + 3O = 3Fe_{2}(SO_{4})_{3} + 3H_{2}O.",
  "The dichromate decomposes in very much the same way as a permanganate\ndoes, the potassium and chromium being both changed into salts in which\nthey play the part of metals, while part of the oxygen of the dichromate\nis liberated.",
  "By combining equations (1) and (2), the following is obtained:",
  "K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7} + 7H_{2}SO_{4} + 6FeSO_{4}\n       = K_{2}SO_{4} + Cr_{2}(SO_{4})_{3} + 3Fe_{2}(SO_{4})_{3} + 7H_{2}0.",
  "This reaction is often employed in the estimation of iron in iron ores.",
  "~Potassium chrome alum.~ It will be noticed that the oxidizing\n     action of potassium dichromate leaves potassium sulphate and\n     chromium sulphate as the products of the reaction. On\n     evaporating the solution these substances crystallize out as\n     potassium chrome alum, which substance is produced as a\n     by-product in the industries using potassium dichromate for\n     oxidizing purposes.",
  "~Chromic anhydride~ (CrO_{3}). When concentrated sulphuric acid is added\nto a strong solution of potassium dichromate, and the liquid allowed to\nstand, deep red needle-shaped crystals appear which have the formula\nCrO_{3}.This oxide of chromium is called chromic anhydride, since it\ncombines readily with water to form chromic acid:",
  "CrO_{3} + H_{2}O = H_{2}CrO_{4}.",
  "It is therefore analogous to sulphur trioxide which forms sulphuric acid\nin a similar way:",
  "SO_{3} + H_{2}O = H_{2}SO_{4}.",

  "2CrO_{3} = Cr_{2}O_{3} + 3O.",
  "~Rare elements of the family.~ Molybdenum, tungsten, and uranium\n     are three rather rare elements belonging in the same family\n     with chromium, and form many compounds which are similar in\n     formulas to the corresponding compounds of chromium. They can\n     play the part of metals and also form acids resembling chromic\n     acid in formula. Thus we have molybdic acid (H_{2}MoO_{4}), the\n     ammonium salt of which is (NH_{4})_{2}MoO_{4}. This salt has\n     the property of combining with phosphoric acid to form a very\n     complex substance which is insoluble in nitric acid. On this\n     account molybdic acid is often used in the estimation of the\n     phosphoric acid present in a substance. Like chromium, the\n     metals are difficult to prepare in pure condition. Alloys with\n     iron can be prepared by reducing the mixed oxides with carbon\n     in an electric furnace; these alloys are used to some extent in\n     preparing special kinds of steel.",

  "~The family.~ Following iron, nickel, and cobalt in the eighth column of\nthe periodic table are two groups of three elements each. The metals of\nthe first of these groups--ruthenium, rhodium, and palladium--have\natomic weights near 100 and densities near 12. The metals of the other\ngroup--iridium, osmium, and platinum--have atomic weights near 200 and\ndensities near 21. These six rare elements have very similar physical\nproperties and resemble each other chemically not only in the type of\ncompounds which they form but also in the great variety of them. They\noccur closely associated in nature, usually as alloys of platinum in the\nform of irregular metallic grains in sand and gravel. Platinum is by far\nthe most abundant of the six.",
  "Although the periodic classification assigns gold to the silver-copper\ngroup, its physical as well as many of its chemical properties much\nmore closely resemble those of the platinum metals, and it can he\nconveniently considered along with them. The four elements gold,\nplatinum, osmium, and iridium are the heaviest substances known, being\nabout twice as heavy as lead.",
  "PLATINUM",
  "~Occurrence.~ About 90% of the platinum of commerce comes from Russia,\nsmall amounts being produced in California, Brazil, and Australia.",
  "~Preparation.~ Native platinum is usually alloyed with gold and the\nplatinum metals. To separate the platinum the alloy is dissolved in aqua\nregia, which converts the platinum into chloroplatinic acid\n(H_{2}PtCl_{6}). Ammonium chloride is then added, which precipitates the\nplatinum as insoluble ammonium chloroplatinate:",
  "H_{2}PtCl_{6} + 2NH_{4}Cl = (NH_{4})_{2}PtCl_{6} + 2HCl.",
  "Some iridium is also precipitated as a similar compound. On ignition the\ndouble chloride is decomposed, leaving the platinum as a spongy metallic\nmass, which is melted in an electric furnace and rolled or hammered into\nthe desired shape.",
  "~Physical properties.~ Platinum is a grayish-white metal of high luster,\nand is very malleable and ductile. It melts in the oxyhydrogen blowpipe\nand in the electric furnace; it is harder than gold and is a good\nconductor of electricity. In finely divided form it has the ability to\nabsorb or occlude gases, especially oxygen and hydrogen. These gases,\nwhen occluded, are in a very active condition resembling the nascent\nstate, and can combine with each other at ordinary temperatures. A jet\nof hydrogen or coal gas directed upon spongy platinum is at once\nignited.",
  "~Platinum as a catalytic agent.~ Platinum is remarkable for its\n     property of acting as a catalytic agent in a large number of\n     chemical reactions, and mention has been made of this use of\n     the metal in connection with the manufacture of sulphuric acid.\n     When desired for this purpose some porous or fibrous substance,\n     such as asbestos, is soaked in a solution of platinic chloride\n     and then ignited. The platinum compound is decomposed and the\n     platinum deposited in very finely divided form. Asbestos\n     prepared in this way is called platinized asbestos. The\n     catalytic action seems to be in part connected with the\n     property of absorbing gases and rendering them nascent. Some\n     other metals possess this same power, notably palladium, which\n     is remarkable for its ability to absorb hydrogen.",
  "~Chemical properties.~ Platinum is a very inactive element chemically, and\nis not attacked by any of the common acids. Aqua regia slowly dissolves\nit, forming platinic chloride (PtCl_{4}), which in turn unites with the\nhydrochloric acid present in the aqua regia, forming the compound\nchloroplatinic acid (H_{2}PtCl_{6}). Platinum is attacked by fused\nalkalis. It combines at higher temperatures with carbon and phosphorus\nand alloys with many metals. It is readily attacked by chlorine but not\nby oxidizing agents.",
  "~Applications.~ Platinum is very valuable as a material for the\nmanufacture of chemical utensils which are required to stand a high\ntemperature or the action of strong reagents. Platinum crucibles,\ndishes, forceps, electrodes, and similar articles are indispensable in\nthe chemical laboratory. In the industries it is used for such purposes\nas the manufacture of pans for evaporating sulphuric acid, wires for\nsealing through incandescent light bulbs, and for making a great variety\nof instruments. Unfortunately the supply of the metal is very limited,\nand the cost is steadily advancing, so that it is now more valuable than\ngold.",
  "~Compounds.~ Platinum forms two series of salts of which platinous\nchloride (PtCl_{2}) and platinic chloride (PtCl_{4}) are examples.\nPlatinates are also known. While a great variety of compounds of\nplatinum have been made, the substance is chiefly employed in the\nmetallic state.",
  "~Platinic chloride (PtCl_{4}).~ Platinic chloride is an orange-colored,\nsoluble compound made by heating chloroplatinic acid in a current of\nchlorine. If hydrochloric acid is added to a solution of the substance,\nthe two combine, forming chloroplatinic acid (H_{2}PtCl_{6}):",
  "2HCl + PtCl_{4} = H_{2}PtCl_{6}.",
  "The potassium and ammonium salts of this acid are nearly insoluble in\nwater and alcohol. The acid is therefore used as a reagent to\nprecipitate potassium in analytical work. With potassium chloride the\nequation is",
  "2KCl + H_{2}PtCl_{6} = K_{2}PtCl_{6} + 2HCl.",
  "~Other metals of the family.~ The other members of the family\n     have few applications. Iridium is used in the form of a\n     platinum alloy, since the alloy is much harder than pure\n     platinum and is even less fusible. This alloy is sometimes used\n     to point gold pens. Osmium tetroxide (OsO_{4}) is a very\n     volatile liquid and is used under the name of osmic acid as a\n     stain for sections in microscopy.",
  "GOLD",
  "~Occurrence.~ Gold has been found in many localities, the most famous\nbeing South Africa, Australia, Russia, and the United States. In this\ncountry it is found in Alaska and in nearly half of the states of the\nunion, notably in California, Colorado, and Nevada. It is usually found\nin the native condition, frequently alloyed with silver; in combination\nit is sometimes found as telluride (AuTe_{2}), and in a few other\ncompounds.",
  "~Mining.~ Native gold occurs in the form of small grains or larger nuggets\nin the sands of old rivers, or imbedded in quartz veins in rocks. In the\nfirst case it is obtained in crude form by placer mining. The sand\ncontaining the gold is shaken or stirred in troughs of running waters\ncalled sluices. This sweeps away the sand but allows the heavier gold to\nsink to the bottom of the sluice. Sometimes the sand containing the gold\nis washed away from its natural location into the sluices by powerful\nstreams of water delivered under pressure from pipes. This is called\nhydraulic mining. In vein mining the gold-bearing quartz is mined from\nthe veins, stamped into fine powder in stamping mills, and the gold\nextracted by one of the processes to be described.",
  "~Extraction.~ 1. _Amalgamation process._ In the amalgamation process the\npowder containing the gold is washed over a series of copper plates\nwhose surfaces have been amalgamated with mercury. The gold sticks to\nthe mercury or alloys with it, and after a time the gold and mercury are\nscraped off and the mixture is distilled. The mercury distills off and\nthe gold is left in the retort ready for refining.",
  "2. _Chlorination process._ When gold occurs along with metallic\nsulphides it is often extracted by chlorination. The ore is first\nroasted, and is then moistened and treated with chlorine. This dissolves\nthe gold but not the metallic oxides:",
  "Au + 3Cl = AuCl_{3}.",
  "The gold chloride, being soluble, is extracted from the mixture with\nwater, and the gold is precipitated from the solution, usually by adding\nferrous sulphate:",
  "AuCl_{3} + 3FeSO_{4} = Au + FeCl_{3} + Fe_{2}(SO_{4})_{3}.",
  "3. _Cyanide process._ This process depends upon the fact that gold is\nsoluble in a solution of potassium cyanide in the presence of the oxygen\nof the air. The powder from the stamping mills is treated with a very\ndilute potassium cyanide solution which extracts the gold:",
  "2Au + 4KCN + H_{2}O + O = 2KOH + 2KAu(CN)_{2}.",
  "From this solution the gold can be obtained by electrolysis or by\nprecipitation with metallic zinc:",
  "2KAu(CN)_{2} + Zn = K_{2}Zn(CN)_{4} + 2Au.",
  "~Refining of gold.~ Gold is refined by three general methods:",
  "1. _Electrolysis._ When gold is dissolved in a solution of potassium\ncyanide, and the solution electrolyzed, the gold is deposited in very\npure condition on the cathode.",
  "2. _Cupellation._ When the gold is alloyed with easily oxidizable\nmetals, such as copper or lead, it may be refined by cupellation. The\nalloy is fused with an oxidizing flame on a shallow hearth made of bone\nash, which substance has the property of absorbing metallic oxides but\nnot the gold. Any silver which may be present remains alloyed with the\ngold.",
  "3. _Parting with sulphuric acid._ Gold may be separated from silver, as\nwell as from many other metals, by heating the alloy with concentrated\nsulphuric acid. This dissolves the silver, while the gold is not\nattacked.",
  "~Physical properties.~ Gold is a very heavy bright yellow metal,\nexceedingly malleable and ductile, and a good conductor of electricity.\nIt is quite soft and is usually alloyed with copper or silver to give it\nthe hardness required for most practical uses. The degree of fineness is\nexpressed in terms of carats, pure gold being twenty-four carats; the\ngold used for jewelry is usually eighteen carats, eighteen parts being\ngold and six parts copper or silver. Gold coinage is 90% gold and 10%\ncopper.",
  "~Chemical properties.~ Gold is not attacked by any one of the common\nacids; aqua regia easily dissolves it, forming gold chloride (AuCl_{3}),\nwhich in turn combines with hydrochloric acid to form chlorauric acid\n(HAuCl_{4}). Fused alkalis also attack it. Most oxidizing agents are\nwithout action upon it, and in general it is not an active element.",
  "~Compounds.~ The compounds of gold, though numerous and varied in\n     character, are of comparatively little importance and need not\n     be described in detail. The element forms two series of salts\n     in which it acts as a metal: in the aurous series the gold is\n     univalent, the chloride having the formula AuCl; in the auric\n     series it is trivalent, auric chloride having the formula\n     AuCl_{3}. Gold also acts as an acid-forming element, forming\n     such compounds as potassium aurate (KAuO_{2}). Its compounds\n     are very easily decomposed, however, metallic gold separating\n     from them.",
  "EXERCISES",
  "1. From the method of preparation of platinum, what metal is likely to\nbe alloyed with it?",
  "2. The \"platinum chloride\" of the laboratory is made by dissolving\nplatinum in aqua regia. What is the compound?",
  "3. How would you expect potassium aurate and platinate to be formed?\nWhat precautions would this suggest in the use of platinum vessels?",

  "CHAPTER XXXII",
  "SOME SIMPLE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS",
  "~Division of chemistry into organic and inorganic.~ Chemistry is usually\ndivided into two great divisions,--organic and inorganic. The original\nsignificance of these terms was entirely different from the meaning\nwhich they have at the present time.",
  "1. _Original significance._ The division into organic and inorganic was\noriginally made because it was believed that those substances which\nconstitute the essential parts of living organisms were built up under\nthe influence of the life force of the organism. Such substances,\ntherefore, should be regarded as different from those compounds prepared\nin the laboratory or formed from the inorganic or mineral constituents\nof the earth. In accordance with this view organic chemistry included\nthose substances formed by living organisms. Inorganic chemistry, on the\nother hand, included all substances formed from the mineral portions of\nthe earth.",
  "In 1828 the German chemist Wöhler prepared urea, a typical organic\ncompound, from inorganic materials. The synthesis of other so-called\norganic compounds followed, and at present it is known that the same\nchemical laws apply to all substances whether formed in the living\norganism or prepared in the laboratory from inorganic constituents. The\nterms \"organic\" and \"inorganic\" have therefore lost their original\nsignificance.",
  "2. _Present significance._ The great majority of the compounds found in\nliving organisms contain carbon, and the term \"organic chemistry,\" as\nused at present, includes not only these compounds but all compounds of\ncarbon. _Organic chemistry_ has become, therefore, _the chemistry of the\ncompounds of carbon_, all other substances being treated under the head\nof inorganic chemistry. This separation of the compounds of carbon into\na group by themselves is made almost necessary by their great number,\nover one hundred thousand having been recorded. For convenience some of\nthe simpler carbon compounds, such as the oxides and the carbonates, are\nusually discussed in inorganic chemistry.",
  "~The grouping of compounds in classes.~ The study of organic chemistry is\nmuch simplified by the fact that the large number of bodies included in\nthis field may be grouped in classes of similar compounds. It thus\nbecomes possible to study the properties of each class as a whole, in\nmuch the same way as we study a group of elements. The most important of\nthese classes are the _hydrocarbons_, the _alcohols_, the _aldehydes_,\nthe _acids_, the _ethereal salts_, the _ethers_, the _ketones_, the\n_organic bases_, and the _carbohydrates_. A few members of each of these\nclasses will now be discussed briefly.",
  "THE HYDROCARBONS",
  "Carbon and hydrogen combine to form a large number of compounds. These\ncompounds are known collectively as the _hydrocarbons_. They may be\ndivided into a number of groups or series, each being named from its\nfirst member. Some of the groups are as follows:",
  "METHANE SERIES\n    CH_{4}      methane\n    C_{2}H_{6}  ethane\n    C_{3}H_{8}  propane\n    C_{4}H_{10} butane\n    C_{5}H_{12} pentane\n    C_{6}H_{14} hexane\n    C_{7}H_{16} heptane\n    C_{8}H_{18} octane",
  "ETHYLENE SERIES\n    C_{2}H_{4} ethylene\n    C_{3}H_{6} propylene\n    C_{4}H_{8} butylene",
  "BENZENE SERIES\n    C_{6}H_{6}  benzene\n    C_{7}H_{8}  toluene\n    C_{8}H_{10} xylene",
  "ACETYLENE SERIES\n    C_{2}H_{2} acetylene\n    C_{3}H_{4} allylene",
  "Only the lower members (that is, those which contain a small number of\ncarbon atoms) of the above groups are given. The methane series is the\nmost extensive, all of the compounds up to C_{24}H_{50} being known.",
  "It will be noticed that the successive members of each of the above\nseries differ by the group of atoms (CH_{2}). Such a series is called an\n_homologous series_. In general, it may be stated that the members of an\nhomologous series show a regular gradation in most physical properties\nand are similar in chemical properties. Thus in the methane group the\nfirst four members are gases at ordinary temperatures; those containing\nfrom five to sixteen carbon atoms are liquids, the boiling points of\nwhich increase with the number of carbon atoms present. Those containing\nmore than sixteen carbon atoms are solids.",
  "~Sources of the hydrocarbons.~ There are two chief sources of the\nhydrocarbons, namely, (1) crude petroleum and (2) coal tar.",
  "1. _Crude petroleum._ This is a liquid pumped from wells driven into the\nearth in certain localities. Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kansas, California, and\nTexas are the chief oil-producing regions in the United States. The\ncrude petroleum consists largely of liquid hydrocarbons in which are\ndissolved both gaseous and solid hydrocarbons. Before being used it must\nbe refined. In this process the petroleum is run into large iron stills\nand subjected to fractional distillation. The various hydrocarbons\ndistill over in the general order of their boiling points. The\ndistillates which collect between certain limits of temperature are kept\nseparate and serve for different uses; they are further purified,\ngenerally by washing with sulphuric acid, then with an alkali, and\nfinally with water. Among the products obtained from crude petroleum in\nthis way are the naphthas, including benzine and gasoline, kerosene or\ncoal oil, lubricating oils, vaseline, and paraffin. None of these\nproducts are definite chemical compounds, but each consists of a mixture\nof hydrocarbons, the boiling points of which lie within certain limits.",
  "2. _Coal tar._ This product is obtained in the manufacture of coal gas,\nas already explained. It is a complex mixture and is refined by the same\ngeneral method used in refining crude petroleum. The principal\nhydrocarbons obtained from the coal tar are benzene, toluene,\nnaphthalene, and anthracene. In addition to the hydrocarbons, coal tar\ncontains many other compounds, such as carbolic acid and aniline.",
  "~Properties of the hydrocarbons.~ The lower members of the first two\nseries of hydrocarbons mentioned are all gases; the succeeding members\nare liquids. In some series, as the methane series, the higher members\nare solids. The preparation and properties of methane and acetylene have\nbeen discussed in a previous chapter. Ethylene is present in small\nquantities in coal gas and may be obtained in the laboratory by\ntreating alcohol (C_{2}H_{6}O) with sulphuric acid:",
  "C_{2}H_{6}O = C_{2}H_{4} + H_{2}O.",
  "Benzene, the first member of the benzene series, is a liquid boiling at\n80°.",
  "The hydrocarbons serve as the materials from which a large number of\ncompounds can be prepared; indeed, it has been proposed to call organic\nchemistry _the chemistry of the hydrocarbon derivatives_.",
  "~Substitution products of the hydrocarbons.~ As a rule, at least a part of\nthe hydrogen in any hydrocarbon can be displaced by an equivalent amount\nof certain elements or groups of elements. Thus the compounds CH_{3}Cl,\nCH_{2}Cl_{2}, CHCl_{3}, CCl_{4} can be obtained from methane by\ntreatment with chlorine. Such compounds are called _substitution\nproducts_.",
  "~Chloroform~ (CHCl_{3}). This can be made by treating methane with\nchlorine, as just indicated, although a much easier method consists in\ntreating alcohol or acetone (which see) with bleaching powder.\nChloroform is a heavy liquid having a pleasant odor and a sweetish\ntaste. It is largely used as a solvent and as an anæsthetic in surgery.",
  "~Iodoform~ (CHI_{3}). This is a yellow crystalline solid obtained by\ntreating alcohol with iodine and an alkali. It has a characteristic odor\nand is used as an antiseptic.",
  "ALCOHOLS",
  "When such a compound as CH_{3}Cl is treated with silver hydroxide the\nreaction expressed by the following equation takes place:",
  "CH_{3}Cl + AgOH = CH_{3}OH + AgCl.",
  "Similarly C_{2}H_{5}Cl will give C_{2}H_{5}OH and AgCl. The compounds\nCH_{3}OH and C_{2}H_{5}OH so obtained belong to the class of substances\nknown as _alcohols_. From their formulas it will be seen that they may\nbe regarded as derived from hydrocarbons by substituting the hydroxyl\ngroup (OH) for hydrogen. Thus the alcohol CH_{3}OH may be regarded as\nderived from methane (CH_{4}) by substituting the group OH for one atom\nof hydrogen. A great many alcohols are known, and, like the\nhydrocarbons, they may be grouped into series. The relation between the\nfirst three members of the methane series and the corresponding alcohols\nis shown in the following table:",
  "CH_{4}     (methane)       CH_{3}OH       (methyl alcohol).\n    C_{2}H_{6} (ethane)        C_{2}H_{5}OH   (ethyl alcohol).\n    C_{3}H_{8} (propane)       C_{3}H_{7}OH   (propyl alcohol).",
  "~Methyl alcohol~ (_wood alcohol_) (CH_{3}OH). When wood is placed in an\nair-tight retort and heated, a number of compounds are evolved, the most\nimportant of which are the three liquids, methyl alcohol, acetic acid,\nand acetone. Methyl alcohol is obtained entirely from this source, and\non this account is commonly called _wood alcohol_. It is a colorless\nliquid which has a density of 0.79 and boils at 67°. It burns with an\nalmost colorless flame and is sometimes used for heating purposes, in\nplace of the more expensive ethyl alcohol. It is a good solvent for\norganic substances and is used especially as a solvent in the\nmanufacture of varnishes. It is very poisonous.",
  "~Ethyl alcohol~ (_common alcohol_) (C_{2}H_{5}OH). 1. _Preparation._ This\ncompound may be prepared from glucose (C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}), a sugar easily\nobtained from starch. If some baker's yeast is added to a solution of\nglucose and the temperature is maintained at about 30°, bubbles of gas\nare soon evolved, showing that a change is taking place. The yeast\ncontains a large number of minute organized bodies, which are really\nforms of plant life. The plant grows in the glucose solution, and in so\ndoing secretes a substance known as _zymase_, which breaks down the\nglucose in accordance with the following equation:",
  "C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} = 2C_{2}H_{5}OH + 2CO_{2}.",
  "~Laboratory preparation of alcohol.~ The formation of alcohol and\n     carbon dioxide from glucose may be shown as follows: About 100\n     g. of glucose are dissolved in a liter of water in flask A\n     (Fig. 90). This flask is connected with the bottle B, which\n     is partially filled with limewater. The tube C contains solid\n     sodium hydroxide. A little baker's yeast is now added to the\n     solution in flask A, and the apparatus is connected, as shown\n     in the figure. If the temperature is maintained at about 30°,\n     the reaction soon begins. The bubbles of gas escape through the\n     limewater in B. A precipitate of calcium carbonate soon forms\n     in the limewater, showing the presence of carbon dioxide. The\n     sodium hydroxide in tube C prevents the carbon dioxide in the\n     air from acting on the limewater. The alcohol remains in the\n     flask A and may be separated by fractional distillation.",
  "[Illustration: Fig. 90]",
  "2. _Properties._ Ethyl alcohol is a colorless liquid with a pleasant\nodor. It has a density of 0.78 and boils at 78°. It resembles methyl\nalcohol in its general properties. It is sometimes used as a source of\nheat, since its flame is very hot and does not deposit carbon, as the\nflame from oil does. When taken into the system in small quantities it\ncauses intoxication; in larger quantities it acts as a poison. The\nintoxicating properties of such liquors as beer, wine, and whisky are\ndue to the alcohol present. Beer contains from 2 to 5% of alcohol, wine\nfrom 5 to 20%, and whisky about 50%. The ordinary alcohol of the\ndruggist contains 94% of alcohol and 6% of water. When this is boiled\nwith lime and then distilled nearly all the water is removed, the\ndistillate being called _absolute alcohol_.",
  "~Commercial preparation of alcohol.~ Alcohol is prepared\n     commercially from starch obtained from corn or potatoes. The\n     starch is first converted into a sugar known as maltose, by the\n     action of _malt_, a substance prepared by moistening barley\n     with water, allowing it to germinate, and then drying it. There\n     is present in the malt a substance known as diastase, which has\n     the property of changing starch into maltose. This sugar, like\n     glucose, breaks down into alcohol and carbon dioxide in the\n     presence of yeast. The resulting alcohol is separated by\n     fractional distillation.",
  "~Denatured alcohol.~ The 94% alcohol is prepared at present at a\n     cost of about 35 cents per gallon, which is about half the cost\n     of the preparation of methyl alcohol. The government, however,\n     imposes a tax on all ethyl alcohol which amounts to $2.08 per\n     gallon on the 94% product. This increases its cost to such an\n     extent that it is not economical to use it for many purposes\n     for which it is adapted, such as a solvent in the preparation\n     of paints and varnishes and as a material for the preparation\n     of many important organic compounds. By an act of Congress in\n     1906, the tax was removed from _denatured_ alcohol, that is\n     alcohol mixed with some substance which renders it unfit for\n     the purposes of a beverage but will not impair its use for\n     manufacturing purposes. Some of the European countries have\n     similar laws. The substances ordinarily used to denature\n     alcohol are wood alcohol and pyridine, the latter compound\n     having a very offensive odor.",
  "~Fermentation.~ The reaction which takes place in the preparation\n     of ethyl alcohol belongs to the class of changes known under\n     the general name of fermentation. Thus we say that the yeast\n     causes the glucose to ferment, and the process is known as\n     alcoholic fermentation. There are many kinds of fermentations,\n     and each is thought to be due to the presence of a definite\n     substance known as an _enzyme_, which acts by catalysis. In\n     many cases, as in alcoholic fermentation, the change is brought\n     about by the action of minute forms of life. These probably\n     secrete the enzymes which cause the fermentation to take place.\n     Thus the yeast plant is supposed to bring about alcoholic\n     fermentation by secreting the enzyme known as zymase.",
  "~Glycerin~ (C_{3}H_{5}(OH)_{3}). This compound may be regarded as derived\nfrom propane (C_{3}H_{8}) by displacing three atoms of hydrogen by three\nhydroxyl groups, and must therefore be regarded as an alcohol. It is\nformed in the manufacture of soaps, as will be explained later. It is an\noily, colorless liquid having a sweetish taste. It is used in medicine\nand in the manufacture of the explosives nitroglycerin and dynamite.",
  "ALDEHYDES",
  "When alcohols are treated with certain oxidizing agents two hydrogen\natoms are removed from each molecule of the alcohol. The resulting\ncompounds are known as aldehydes. The relation of the aldehydes derived\nfrom methyl and ethyl alcohol to the alcohols themselves may be shown as\nfollows:",
  "Alcohols  {CH_{3}OH          Corresponding aldehydes  {CH_{2}O\n              {C_{2}H_{5}OH                               {C_{2}H_{4}O",
  "The first of these (CH_{2}O) is a gas known as formaldehyde. Its aqueous\nsolution is largely used as an antiseptic and disinfectant under the\nname of _formalin_. Acetaldehyde (C_{2}H_{4}O) is a liquid boiling at\n21°.",
  "ACIDS",
  "Like the other classes of organic compounds, the organic acids may be\narranged in homologous series. One of the most important of these series\nis the _fatty-acid series_, the name having been given to it because\nthe derivatives of certain of its members are constituents of the fats.\nSome of the most important members of the series are given in the\nfollowing table. They are all monobasic, and this fact is expressed in\nthe formulas by separating the replaceable hydrogen atom from the rest\nof the molecule:",

  "~Formic acid~ (H·CHO_{2}). The name \"formic\" is derived from the Latin\n_formica_, signifying ant. This name was given to the acid because it\nwas formerly obtained from a certain kind of ants. It is a colorless\nliquid and occurs in many plants such as the stinging nettles. The\ninflammation caused by the sting of the bee is due to formic acid.",
  "~Acetic acid~ (H·C_{2}H_{3}O_{2}). Acetic acid is the acid present in\nvinegar, the sour taste being due to it. It can be prepared by either of\nthe following methods.",
  "1. _Acetic fermentation._ This consists in the change of alcohol into\nacetic acid through the agency of a minute organism commonly called\nmother of vinegar. The change is represented by the following equation:",
  "C_{2}H_{5}OH + 2O = HC_{2}H_{3}O_{2} + H_{2}O.",
  "The various kinds of vinegars are all made by this process. In the\nmanufacture of cider vinegar the sugar present in the cider first\nundergoes alcoholic fermentation; the resulting alcohol then undergoes\nacetic fermentation. The amount of acetic acid present in vinegars\nvaries from 3 to 6%.",
  "2. _From the distillation of wood._ The liquid obtained by heating wood\nin the absence of air contains a large amount of acetic acid, and this\ncan be separated readily in a pure state. This is the most economical\nmethod for the preparation of the concentrated acid.",
  "Acetic acid is a colorless liquid and has a strong pungent odor.\nMany of its salts are well-known compounds. Lead acetate\n(Pb(C_{2}H_{3}O_{2})_{2}) is the ordinary _sugar of lead_. Sodium\nacetate (NaC_{2}H_{3}O_{2}) is a white solid largely used in making\nchemical analyses. Copper acetate (Cu(C_{2}H_{3}O_{2})_{2}) is a blue\nsolid. When copper is acted upon by acetic acid in the presence of air a\ngreen basic acetate of copper is formed. This is commonly known as\nverdigris. All acetates are soluble in water.",
  "~Butyric acid~ (H·C_{4}H_{7}O_{2}). Derivatives of butyric acid are\npresent in butter and impart to it its characteristic flavor.",
  "~Palmitic and stearic acids.~ Ordinary fats consist principally of\nderivatives of palmitic and stearic acids. When the fats are heated with\nsodium hydroxide the sodium salts of these acids are formed. If\nhydrochloric acid is added to a solution of the sodium salts, the free\npalmitic and stearic acids are precipitated. They are white solids,\ninsoluble in water. Stearic acid is often used in making candles.",
  "~Acids belonging to other series.~ In addition to members of the\nfatty-acid series, mention may be made of the following well-known\nacids.",
  "~Oxalic acid~ (H_{2}C_{2}O_{4}). This is a white solid which occurs in\nnature in many plants, such as the sorrels. Its ammonium salt\n((NH_{4})_{2}C_{2}O_{4}) is used as a reagent for the detection of\ncalcium. When added to a solution of a calcium compound the white,\ninsoluble calcium oxalate (CaC_{2}O_{4}) precipitates.",
  "~Tartaric acid~ (H_{2}·C_{4}H_{4}O_{6}). This compound occurs either in a\nfree state or in the form of its salts in many fruits. The potassium\nacid salt (KHC_{4}H_{4}O_{6}) occurs in the juice of grapes. When the\njuice ferments in the manufacture of wine, this salt, being insoluble in\nalcohol, separates out on the sides of the cask and in this form is\nknown as argol. This is more or less colored by the coloring matter of\nthe grape. When purified it forms a white solid and is sold under the\nname of cream of tartar. The following are also well-known salts of\ntartaric acid: potassium sodium tartrate (Rochelle salt)\n(KNaC_{4}H_{4}O_{6}), potassium antimonyl tartrate (tartar emetic)\n(KSbOC_{4}H_{4}O_{6}).",
  "~Cream of tartar baking powders.~ The so-called cream of tartar\n     baking powders consist of a mixture of cream of tartar,\n     bicarbonate of soda, and some starch or flour. When water is\n     added to this mixture the cream of tartar slowly acts upon the\n     soda present liberating carbon dioxide in accordance with the\n     following equation:",
  "KHC_{4}H_{4}O_{6} + NaHCO_{3} = KNaC_{4}H_{4}O_{6} + H_{2}O +\n     CO_{2}.",
  "The carbon dioxide evolved escapes through the dough, thus\n     making it light and porous.",
  "~Citric acid~ (H_{3}·C_{6}H_{5}O_{7}). This acid occurs in many fruits,\nespecially in lemons. It is a white solid, soluble in water, and is\noften used as a substitute for lemons in making lemonade.",
  "~Lactic acid~ (H·C_{3}H_{5}O_{3}). This is a liquid which is formed in the\nsouring of milk.",
  "~Oleic acid~ (H·C_{18}H_{33}O_{2}). The derivatives of this acid\nconstitute the principal part of many oils and liquid fats. The acid\nitself is an oily liquid.",
  "ETHEREAL SALTS",
  "When acids are brought in contact with alcohols under certain conditions\na reaction takes place similar to that which takes place between acids\nand bases. The following equations will serve as illustrations:",
  "KOH + HNO_{3} = KNO_{3} + H_{2}O,",
  "CH_{3}OH + HNO_{3} = CH_{3}NO_{3} + H_{2}O.",
  "The resulting compounds of which methyl nitrate (CH_{3}NO_{3}) may be\ntaken as the type belong to the class known as _ethereal salts_, the\nname having been given them because some of them possess pleasant\nethereal odors. It will be seen that the ethereal salts differ from\nordinary salts in that they contain a hydrocarbon radical, such as\nCH_{3}, C_{2}H_{5}, C_{3}H_{5}, in place of a metal.",
  "~The nitrates of glycerin~ (_nitroglycerin_). Nitric acid reacts with\nglycerin in the same way that it reacts with a base containing three\nhydroxyl groups such as Fe(OH)_{3}:",
  "Fe(OH)_{3} + 3HNO_{3} = Fe(NO_{3})_{3} + 3H_{2}O,",
  "C_{3}H_{5}(OH)_{3} + 3HNO_{3} = C_{3}H_{5}(NO_{3})_{3} + 3H_{2}O.",
  "The resulting nitrate (C_{3}H_{5}(NO_{3})_{3}) is the main constituent\nof _nitroglycerin_, a slightly yellowish oil characterized by its\nexplosive properties. Dynamite consists of porous earth which has\nabsorbed nitroglycerin, and its strength depends on the amount present.\nIt is used much more largely than nitroglycerin itself, since it does\nnot explode so readily by concussion and hence can be transported with\nsafety.",
  "~The fats.~ These are largely mixtures of the ethereal salts known\nrespectively as olein, palmitin, and stearin. These salts may be\nregarded as derived from oleic, palmitic, and stearic acids\nrespectively, by replacing the hydrogen of the acid with the glycerin\nradical C_{3}H_{5}. Since this radical is trivalent and oleic, palmitic,\nand stearic acids contain only one replaceable hydrogen atom to the\nmolecule, it is evident that three molecules of each acid must enter\ninto each molecule of the ethereal salt. The formulas for the acids and\nthe ethereal salts derived from each are as follows:",
  "HC_{18}H_{33}O_{2}                 (oleic acid)\n    C_{8}H_{6}(C_{18}H_{33}O_{2})_{3}, (olein)",

  "Olein is a liquid and is the main constituent of liquid fats. Palmitin\nand stearin are solids.",
  "~Butter fat and oleomargarine.~ Butter fat consists principally of olein,\npalmitin, and stearin. The flavor of the fat is due to the presence of a\nsmall amount of butyrin, which is an ethereal salt of butyric acid.\nOleomargarine differs from butter mainly in the fact that a smaller\namount of butyrin is present. It is made from the fats obtained from\ncattle and hogs. This fat is churned up with milk, or a small amount of\nbutter is added, in order to furnish sufficient butyrin to impart the\nbutter flavor.",
  "~Saponification.~ When an ethereal salt is heated with an alkali a\nreaction expressed by the following equation takes place:",
  "C_{2}H_{5}NO_{3} + KOH = C_{2}H_{5}OH + KNO_{3}.",
  "This process is known as _saponification_, since it is the one which\ntakes place in the manufacture of soaps. The ordinary soaps are made by\nheating fats with a solution of sodium hydroxide. The reactions\ninvolved may be illustrated by the following equation representing the\nreaction between palmitin and sodium hydroxide:",
  "C_{3}H_{5}(C_{16}H_{31}O_{2})_{3} + 3 NaOH\n         = 3 NaC_{16}H_{31}O_{2} + C_{3}H_{5}(OH)_{3}.",
  "In accordance with this equation the ethereal salts in the fats are\nconverted into glycerin and the sodium salts of the corresponding acids.\nThe sodium salts are separated and constitute the soaps. These salts are\nsoluble in water. When added to water containing calcium salts the\ninsoluble calcium palmitate and stearate are precipitated. Magnesium\nsalts act in a similar way. It is because of these facts that soap is\nused up by hard waters.",
  "ETHERS",
  "When ethyl alcohol is heated to 140° with sulphuric acid the reaction\nexpressed by the following equation takes place:",
  "2C_{2}H_{5}OH = (C_{2}H_{5})_{2}O + H_{2}O.",
  "The resulting compound, (C_{2}H_{5})_{2}O, is ordinary ether and is the\nmost important member of the class of compounds called _ethers_.\nOrdinarily ether is a light, very inflammable liquid boiling at 35°. It\nis used as a solvent for organic substances and as an anæsthetic in\nsurgical operations.",
  "KETONES",
  "The most common member of this group is acetone (C_{3}H_{6}O), a\ncolorless liquid obtained when wood is heated in the absence of air. It\nis used in the preparation of other organic compounds, especially\nchloroform.",
  "ORGANIC BASES",
  "This group includes a number of compounds, all of which contain nitrogen\nas well as carbon. They are characterized by combining directly with\nacids to form salts, and in this respect they resemble ammonia. They\nmay, indeed, be regarded as derived from ammonia by displacing a part or\nall of the hydrogen present in ammonia by hydrocarbon radicals. Among\nthe simplest of these compounds may be mentioned methylamine\n(CH_{3}NH_{2}) and ethylamine (C_{2}H_{5}NH_{2}). These two compounds\nare gases and are formed in the distillation of wood and bones. Pyridine\n(C_{5}H_{6}N) and quinoline (C_{9}H_{7}N) are liquids present in small\namounts in coal tar, and also in the liquid obtained by the distillation\nof bones. Most of the compounds now classified under the general name of\n_alkaloids_ (which see) also belong to this group.",
  "CARBOHYDRATES",
  "The term \"carbohydrate\" is applied to a class of compounds which\nincludes the sugars, starch, and allied bodies These compounds contain\ncarbon, hydrogen, and oxygen the last two elements generally being\npresent in the proportion in which they combine to form water. The most\nimportant members of this class are the following:",
  "Cane sugar      C_{12}H_{22}O_{11}.\n    Milk sugar      C_{12}H_{22}O_{11}.\n    Dextrose        C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}.\n    Levulose        C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}.\n    Cellulose       C_{6}H_{10}O_{5}.\n    Starch          C_{6}H_{10}0_{5}.",
  "~Cane sugar~ (C_{12}H_{22}O_{11}). This is the well-known substance\ncommonly called sugar. It occurs in many plants especially in the sugar\ncane and sugar beet. It was formerly obtained almost entirely from the\nsugar cane, but at present the greatest amount of it comes from the\nsugar beet. The juice from the cane or beet contains the sugar in\nsolution along with many impurities. These impurities are removed, and\nthe resulting solution is then evaporated until the sugar crystallizes\nout. The evaporation is conducted in closed vessels from which the air\nis partially exhausted. In this way the boiling point of the solution is\nlowered and the charring of the sugar is prevented. It is impossible to\nremove all the sugar from the solution. In preparing sugar from sugar\ncane the liquors left after separating as much of it as possible from\nthe juice of the cane constitute ordinary molasses. Maple sugar is made\nby the evaporation of the sap obtained from a species of the maple tree.\nIts sweetness is due to the presence of cane sugar, other products\npresent in the maple sap imparting the distinctive flavor.",
  "When a solution of cane sugar is heated with hydrochloric or other\ndilute mineral acid, two compounds, dextrose and levulose, are formed in\naccordance with the following equation:",
  "C_{12}H_{22}O_{11} + H_{2}O = C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}.",
  "This same change is brought about by the action of an enzyme present in\nthe yeast plant. When yeast is added to a solution of cane sugar\nfermentation is set up. The cane sugar, however, does not ferment\ndirectly: the enzyme in the yeast first transforms the sugar into\ndextrose and levulose, and these sugars then undergo alcoholic\nfermentation.",
  "When heated to 160° cane sugar melts; if the temperature is increased to\nabout 215°, a partial decomposition takes place and a brown substance\nknown as caramel forms. This is used largely as a coloring matter.",
  "~Milk sugar~ (C_{12}H_{22}O_{11}). This sugar is present in the milk of\nall mammals. The average composition of cow's milk is as follows:",
  "Water                        87.17%\n    Casein (nitrogenous matter)   3.56\n    Butter fat                    3.64\n    Milk sugar                    4.88\n    Mineral matter                0.75",
  "When _rennin_, an enzyme obtained from the stomach of calves, is added\nto milk, the casein separates and is used in the manufacture of cheese.\nThe remaining liquid contains the milk sugar which separates on\nevaporation; it resembles cane sugar in appearance but is not so sweet\nor soluble. The souring of milk is due to the fact that the milk sugar\npresent undergoes _lactic fermentation_ in accordance with the equation",
  "C_{12}H_{22}O_{11} + H_{2}O = 4C_{3}H_{6}O_{3}.",
  "The lactic acid formed causes the separation of the casein, thus giving\nthe well-known appearance of sour milk.",
  "~Isomeric compounds.~ It will be observed that cane sugar and milk sugar\nhave the same formulas. Their difference in properties is due to the\ndifferent arrangement of the atoms in the molecule. Such compounds are\nsaid to be isomeric. Dextrose and levulose are also isomeric.",
  "~Dextrose~ (_grape sugar, glucose_) (C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}). This sugar is\npresent in many fruits and is commonly called grape sugar because of its\npresence in grape juice. It can be obtained by heating cane sugar with\ndilute acids, as explained above; also by heating starch with dilute\nacids, the change being as follows:",
  "C_{6}H_{10}6_{5} + H_{2}O = C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}.",
  "Pure dextrose is a white crystalline solid, readily soluble in water,\nand is not so sweet as cane sugar. In the presence of yeast it undergoes\nalcoholic fermentation. It is prepared from starch in large quantities,\nand being less expensive than cane sugar, is used as a substitute for it\nin the manufacture of jellies, jams, molasses, candy, and other sweets.\nThe product commonly sold under the name of _glucose_ contains about 45%\nof dextrose.",
  "~Levulose~ _(fruit sugar)_(C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}). This sugar is a white solid\nwhich occurs along with dextrose in fruits and honey. It undergoes\nalcoholic fermentation in the presence of yeast.",
  "~Cellulose~ (C_{6}H_{10}O_{5}). This forms the basis of all woody fibers.\nCotton and linen are nearly pure cellulose. It is insoluble in water,\nalcohol, and dilute acids. Sulphuric acid slowly converts it into\ndextrose. Nitric acid forms nitrates similar to nitroglycerin in\ncomposition and explosive properties. These nitrates are variously known\nas nitrocellulose, pyroxylin, and gun cotton. When exploded they yield\nonly colorless gases; hence they are used especially in the manufacture\nof smokeless gunpowder. _Collodion_ is a solution of nitrocellulose in a\nmixture of alcohol and ether. _Celluloid_ is a mixture of nitrocellulose\nand camphor. _Paper_ consists mainly of cellulose, the finer grades\nbeing made from linen and cotton rags, and the cheaper grades from straw\nand wood.",
  "~Starch~ (C_{6}H_{10}O_{5}). This is by far the most abundant carbohydrate\nfound in nature, being present especially in seeds and tubers. In the\nUnited States it is obtained chiefly from corn, nearly 80% of which is\nstarch. In Europe it is obtained principally from the potato. It\nconsists of minute granules and is practically insoluble in cold water.\nThese granules differ somewhat in appearance, according to the source of\nthe starch, so that it is often possible to determine from what plant\nthe starch was obtained. When heated with water the granules burst and\nthe starch partially dissolves. Dilute acids, as well as certain\nenzymes, convert it into dextrose or similar sugars. When seeds\ngerminate the starch present is converted into soluble sugars, which are\nused as food for the growing plant.",
  "~Chemical changes in bread making.~ The average composition of wheat flour\nis as follows:",
  "Water.                           13.8%\n    Protein (nitrogenous matter)      7.9\n    Fats                              1.4\n    Starch                           76.4\n    Mineral matter                    0.5",
  "In making bread the flour is mixed with water and yeast, and the\nresulting dough set aside in a warm place for a few hours. The yeast\nfirst converts a portion of the starch into dextrose or a similar sugar,\nwhich then undergoes alcoholic fermentation. The carbon dioxide formed\nescapes through the dough, making it light and porous. The yeast plant\nthrives best at about 30°; hence the necessity for having the dough in a\nwarm place. If the temperature rises above 50°, the vitality of the\nyeast is destroyed and fermentation ceases. In baking the bread, the\nheat expels the alcohol and also expands the bubbles of carbon dioxide\ncaught in the dough, thus increasing its lightness.",
  "SOME DERIVATIVES OF BENZENE",
  "Attention has been called to the complex nature of coal tar. Among the\ncompounds present are the hydrocarbons, benzene, toluene, naphthalene,\nand anthracene. These compounds are not only useful in themselves but\nserve for the preparation of many other important compounds known under\nthe general name of coal-tar products.",
  "~Nitrobenzene~ (_oil of myrbane_) (C_{6}H_{5}NO_{2}). When benzene is\ntreated with nitric acid a reaction takes place which is expressed by\nthe following equation:",
  "C_{6}H_{6} + HNO_{3} = C_{6}H_{5}NO_{2} + H_{2}O.",
  "The product C_{6}H_{5}NO_{2} is called nitrobenzene. It is a slightly\nyellowish poisonous liquid, with a characteristic odor. Its main use is\nin the manufacture of aniline.",
  "~Aniline~ (C_{6}H_{5}NH_{2}). When nitrobenzene is heated with iron and\nhydrochloric acid the hydrogen evolved by the action of the iron upon\nthe acid reduces the nitrobenzene in accordance with the following\nequation:",
  "C_{6}H_{5}NO_{2} + 6H = C_{6}H_{5}NH_{2} + 2H_{2}O.",
  "The resulting compound is known as aniline, a liquid boiling at 182°.\nWhen first prepared it is colorless, but darkens on standing. Large\nquantities of it are used in the manufacture of the _aniline or coal-tar\ndyes_, which include many important compounds.",
  "~Carbolic acid~ (C_{6}H_{5}OH). This compound, sometimes known as\n_phenol_, occurs in coal tar, and is also prepared from benzene. It\nforms colorless crystals which are very soluble in water. It is strongly\ncorrosive and very poisonous.",
  "~Naphthalene and anthracene.~ These are hydrocarbons occurring along with\nbenzene in coal tar. They are white solids, insoluble in water. The\nwell-known _moth balls_ are made of naphthalene. Large quantities of\nnaphthalene are used in the preparation of _indigo_, a dye formerly\nobtained from the indigo plant, but now largely prepared by laboratory\nmethods. Similarly anthracene is used in the preparation of the dye\n_alizarin_, which was formerly obtained from the madder root.",
  "THE ALKALOIDS",
  "This term is applied to a group of compounds found in many plants and\ntrees. They all contain nitrogen, and most of them are characterized by\ntheir power to combine with acids to form salts. This property is\nindicated by the name alkaloids, which signifies alkali-like. The salts\nare soluble in water, and on this account are more largely used than the\nfree alkaloids, which are insoluble in water. Many of the alkaloids are\nused in medicine, some of the more important ones being given below.",
  "~Quinine.~ This alkaloid occurs along with a number of others in the bark\nof certain trees which grow in districts in South America and also in\nJava and other tropical islands. It is a white solid, and its sulphate\nis used in medicine in the treatment of fevers.",
  "~Morphine.~ When incisions are made in the unripe capsules of one of the\nvarieties of the poppy plant, a milky juice exudes which soon thickens.\nThis is removed and partially dried. The resulting substance is the\nordinary _opium_ which contains a number of alkaloids, the principal one\nbeing morphine. This alkaloid is a white solid and is of great service\nin medicine.",
  "Among the other alkaloids may be mentioned the following: _Nicotine_, a\nvery poisonous liquid, the salts of which occur in the leaves of the\ntobacco plant; _cocaine_, a crystalline solid present in coca leaves and\nused in medicine as a local anæsthetic; _atropine_, a solid present in\nthe berry of the deadly nightshade, and used in the treatment of\ndiseases of the eye; _strychnine_, a white, intensely poisonous solid\npresent in the seeds of the members of the _Strychnos_ family.",

  "AN ELEMENTARY STUDY OF CHEMISTRY",
  "By WILLIAM McPHERSON, Professor of Chemistry in Ohio State University,\nand WILLIAM E. HENDERSON, Associate Professor of Chemistry in Ohio State\nUniversity.",
  "12mo. Cloth. 434 pages. Illustrated. List price, $1.25; mailing price,\n$1.40",
  "This book is the outgrowth of many years of experience in the teaching\nof elementary chemistry. In its preparation the authors have steadfastly\nkept in mind the limitations of the student to whom chemistry is a new\nscience. They have endeavored to present the subject in a clear,\nwell-graded way, passing in a natural and logical manner from principles\nwhich are readily understood to those which are more difficult to grasp.\nThe language is simple and as free as possible from unusual and\ntechnical phrases. Those which are unavoidable are carefully defined.\nThe outline is made very plain, and the paragraphing is designed to be\nof real assistance to the student in his reading.",
  "The book is in no way radical, either in the subject-matter selected or\nin the method of treatment. At the same time it is in thorough harmony\nwith the most recent developments in chemistry, both in respect to\ntheory and discovery. Great care has been taken in the theoretical\nportions to make the treatment simple and well within the reach of the\nability of an elementary student. The most recent discoveries have been\ntouched upon where they come within the scope of an elementary text.\nEspecial attention has been given to the practical applications of\nchemistry, and to the description of the manufacturing processes in use\nat the present time.",

  "This one-year course in physics has grown out of the experience of the\nauthors in developing the work in physics at the School of Education of\nThe University of Chicago, and in dealing with the physics instruction\nin affiliated high schools and academies.",
  "The book is a simple, objective presentation of the subject as opposed\nto a formal and mathematical one. It is intended for the third-year\nhigh-school pupils and is therefore adapted in style and method of\ntreatment to the needs of students between the ages of fifteen and\neighteen. It especially emphasizes the historical and practical aspects\nof the subject and connects the study very intimately with facts of\ndaily observation and experience.",
  "The authors have made a careful distinction between the class of\nexperiments which are essentially laboratory problems and those which\nbelong more properly to the classroom and the lecture table. The former\nare grouped into a Laboratory Manual which is designed for use in\nconnection with the text. The two books are not, however, organically\nconnected, each being complete in itself.",
  "All the experiments included in the work have been carefully chosen with\nreference to their usefulness as effective classroom demonstrations.",
